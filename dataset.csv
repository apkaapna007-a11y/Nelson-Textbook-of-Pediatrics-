from childhood to adulthood. This period of development comprises
adolescence, which is divided into three phases—early, middle, and
late adolescence—each marked by a characteristic set of biologic, cognitive, and psychosocial milestones (Table 150.1). Although individual
variations in the timing and pace of development undoubtedly exist,
these changes follow a predictable pattern of occurrence. Gender and
culture profoundly affect the developmental course, as do physical,
social, and environmental influences (Fig. 150.1). Given the interaction of these domains, a biopsychosocial perspective is best suited to

6,Chapter Unknown,General,400,"of reproductive capacity. Two principal physiologic events occur
during puberty: adrenarche and gonadarche. Adrenal androgen production, chiefly dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), rises in
response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Increases in serum
concentrations of DHEAS result in the development of adult-­like body
odor and faint genital hair (adrenarche), occurring as early as 6-­8 years
of age. Gonadal sex steroid production occurs with activation of the
hypothalamic-­pituitary-­gonadal (HPG) axis (gonadarche). Maturation of the gonadotropin-­releasing hormone (GnRH) pulse generator
is among the earliest neuroendocrine changes associated with the onset
of puberty. Under the influence of GnRH, the pituitary gland secretes
luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-­stimulating hormone (FSH);
initially this occurs in a pulsatile fashion primarily during sleep, but
this diurnal variation diminishes throughout puberty. LH and FSH
stimulate corresponding increases in gonadal androgens and estrogens. The triggers for these changes are incompletely understood. The
activation of the HPG axis may be mediated by increasing adiposity
and associated insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, elevated androgens, and leptin. Both genetic and environmental (epigenetic) factors
contribute to the regulation of pubertal timing.",hyperinsulinemia|development,Adolescent Medicine,Adolescent,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z

Although the ages at which individual pubertal changes occur may
vary, the timing and sequence of these changes relative to one another

exposures may also play a role.
In males the first visible sign of puberty and the hallmark of SMR 2
is testicular enlargement, beginning as early as 9.5 years, followed by
the development of pubic hair. This is followed by penile growth during

middle adolescents. Same-­sex attraction is common; sexual orientation may become clear to some adolescents, but still may be evolving in others during this time. Dating behaviors may be seen, but
this is culture dependent and may not be a popular construct for all
adolescents. Individual relationships often continue to emphasize
sexual attraction over emotional intimacy. Relationships that occur
during middle adolescence may be short and intense. Emotional
intimacy and more permanent relationships may not be seen until
late adolescence. At that time, relationships increasingly involve
love and commitment and demonstrate greater stability.
Body image may affect (and be affected by) adolescents’ psychosocial development as well. Early and middle adolescence are usually the ages during which poor or distorted body image and eating
disorders develop. Early adolescents undergo rapid physical changes
and may experience uncertainty about whether all these anatomic
and physiologic changes are progressing normally. Reassurance
from adults, including their healthcare providers, may be comforting. As puberty comes to an end and these changes slow, the middle
adolescent’s preoccupation may shift to whether they are attractive
to others. A strong emphasis on physical appearance during this
time is common. Although this focus on physical appearance may
continue into adulthood, late adolescence generally is characterized by a shifting balance toward introspection, with somewhat less
emphasis placed on external characteristics.
The timing of pubertal changes also can affect psychosocial development and well-­being. The progression of pubertal changes in males
is generally associated with a positive self-­
image. Early-­
maturing
males tend to have greater self-­confidence, social, and academic success, whereas later-­maturing males are at risk for more internalizing
behaviors and diminished self-­esteem. Females may initially perceive
changes in their physical appearance more negatively. This appears to
be especially true for early-­maturing females, some of whom experience greater decreases in self-­esteem, engage in more disruptive
behaviors, and have more conflict with their parents than do on-­time
or late-­maturing females. Early-­maturing females may be more comfortable associating with older peers and may subsequently be exposed
to peer pressure around things like sexual activity and substance use
at younger ages. Still lacking the cognitive skills to effectively navigate
these situations, they may be vulnerable to making poor decisions that
place their health and safety at risk. Many other factors influence how
adolescents experience puberty, and supportive peers and adults can
have a positive impact on psychosocial development at any maturational stage. With successful navigation of these domains, emerging
adults move into the world with a strong sense of personal identity
and their place in society. They are able to work toward a vocation
and financial independence and to manage the responsibilities of
adulthood.",adolescent|disorder|development,Adolescent Medicine,Adolescent,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z

13,Chapter Unknown,General,750,"As adolescents develop more independence and parent–child
conflict peaks, providers should remind parents that this is typical and that arguing does not mean the adolescent does not value
the parents’ input and perspectives. Although some may rebel initially, most adolescents ultimately adopt a value system very similar
to that of their parents. Even if discussions feel ineffective to parents, they should continue to demonstrate and model these values
to their child. Similarly, rather than categorically dismissing their
child’s “negative” interests, such as playing a violent video game,
parents should be encouraged to use these opportunities to model
critical thinking about the impact of such an activity. Potentially
negative peer groups may be approached the same way, while fostering the development of positive peer networks. Authoritative
parenting, in which clear and appropriate negotiated limits are
set in the context of a caring and mutually respectful parent–child
relationship, is most strongly associated with positive psychosocial development. Parental connectedness and close supervision or
monitoring of the youth’s activities and peer group can be protective
against early onset of sexual activity and involvement in behaviors
that may threaten their safety and can foster positive youth development. Parents should also assume an active role in their adolescent’s
transition to adulthood to ensure that their child receives appropriate preventive health services.
Parents and providers may each work with adolescents to foster
good decision-­making. In addition to providing adolescents with
accurate and complete health information, the adolescent’s cognitive ability to use this information in various contexts must be
considered. Visits with providers can be used to promote independence among adolescents by spending time separately with both
caregivers and the adolescent, allowing the adolescent space to
voice concerns and receive appropriate information about making
healthy decisions and recognizing behaviors that may be placing
their health at risk.
Adolescents may find themselves needing to make important decisions in highly charged situations where they may be unable to manage their emotions and use their higher cognitive functions to examine
the consequences of their decision. For example, a couple in a sexual
situation with high emotional arousal may make the decision to proceed with unprotected intercourse. By anticipating this situation ahead
of time, under conditions of lower emotional arousal, and making a
plan to deal with this, they may make a different decision (e.g., stick
with their prior decision never to have sex without protection) when
the time comes. Parents and healthcare providers are in a position to
encourage and foster this anticipation and planning under conditions
of “cool cognition.”
Providers may need to help parents distinguish normal adolescent development and risk-­taking behaviors from possible signs of
a more serious mental health or conduct problem. Bids for autonomy, such as avoiding family activities, demanding privacy, and
increasing argumentativeness, are normal; extreme withdrawal
or antagonism may be dysfunctional, signaling a mental health or
substance use concern. Bewilderment and dysphoria at the start of
middle school are normal; continued failure to adapt several months
later suggests a more serious problem. Although some degree of risk
taking is normal, progressive escalation of risk-­taking behaviors
is problematic. In general, when the adolescent’s behaviors cause
significant dysfunction in the domains of home life, academics,
or peer relationships, they should be addressed by the parents and
healthcare provider, and referral to a mental health provider may be
considered. In most cases, parents can be reassured that although
adolescence can pose unique challenges, their adolescent, like most
adolescents, will come through it to become a successful and happy
adult.
At national and international levels, adolescents are at risk for environmental, health, behavioral, and societal challenges. Table 150.4 provides suggestions to address these issues.

Healthcare providers play an important role in nurturing healthy
behaviors among adolescents, because the leading causes of death and
disability among adolescents are preventable. Adolescence provides
a unique opportunity to prevent or modify health conditions arising
from behaviors that develop in the second decade of life and that can
lead to substantial morbidity and mortality, such as trauma, suicide,
cardiovascular and pulmonary disease, type 2 diabetes, reproductive
health issues, and cancer (see Chapter 150, Table 150.4).
Health systems in each community should be in place to ensure comprehensive and high-­quality care to adolescents. Health insurance coverage that is affordable, continuous, confidential, and not subject to

Quality-­of-­care data should be collected and analyzed by age so that the
performance measures for age-­appropriate healthcare needs of adolescents are monitored. Affordability is important for access to preventive
services. Family involvement should be encouraged, but confidentiality
and adolescent consent are critically important and should be addressed
with intentionality at each visit.
Healthcare providers, trained and experienced in adolescent care, should
be available in all communities. Healthcare providers should be adequately
compensated to support the range and intensity of services required to
address the developmental and health service needs of adolescents. The
development and dissemination of provider education about adolescent
preventive health guidelines have been demonstrated to improve the
content of recommended care (Table 151.1). The ease of recognition or
expectation that an adolescent’s needs can be addressed in a setting relates
to the visibility and flexibility of sites and services. Staff at sites should be
approachable, linguistically capable, culturally humble, and able to balance
trauma-­
informed care with healing-­
centered engagement approaches
with attention to equity and social determinants of health. Health services
should be coordinated to respond to goals for adolescent health at the
local, state, and national levels. The coordination should address service
financing and delivery in a manner that reduces disparities in care.
Although most adolescents in the United States have seen a
healthcare provider in the past year and report a usual source of
healthcare, adolescents are less likely to receive preventive care
services. According to the 2019 National Health Interview Survey,
an estimated 92% of 12-­to 17-­year-­old U.S. adolescents had a well
child visit within the past year. Uninsured adolescents are the least
likely to receive care. The National Health Interview Survey found

The time spent on various elements of the screening will vary with
the issues that surface during the assessment. However, time for
screening and assessment is important for all adolescents, and the
ideal model of adolescent care requires a minimum of 20 minutes per
visit. For lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, intersex, and asexual youth (see
Chapters 153 and 154), emotional and psychologic concerns related to
their experiences, from fear of disclosure to the trauma of discrimination or bullying or violence, may direct the clinician to spend more
time assessing emotional and psychologic supports in the young person’s environment. For youth with chronic illnesses or special needs,
the assessment of at-­risk behaviors should not be omitted or deemphasized by assuming they do not experience the “normal” adolescent
vulnerabilities.

poses a new challenge to the provision of confidential health services
to adolescents.
Providers may elect to establish a policy of discussing with their adolescent patients when medical records and other information will be
disclosed and developing a mechanism to alert office staff as to what

24,Chapter 12,General,1300,"The preparation for a successful interview with an adolescent patient
varies based on the history of the relationship with the patient.
Patients (and their parents) who are going from preadolescence
to adolescence while seeing the same provider should be guided
through the transition. Although the rules for confidentiality are
the same for new and continuing patients, the change in the physician–patient relationship, allowing more privacy during the visit
and more autonomy in the health process, may be threatening for
the parent and the adolescent. For new patients, the initial phases
of the interview are more challenging given the need to establish
rapport rapidly with the patient in order to meet the goals of the
encounter. Issues of confidentiality and privacy should be explicitly stated along with the conditions under which that confidentiality may need to be altered, that is, in life-­or safety-­threatening
situations. For new patients, the parents should be interviewed with
the adolescent or before the adolescent to ensure that the adolescent does not perceive a breach of confidentiality. The clinician
who takes time to listen, avoids judgmental statements and the use
of street jargon, and shows respect for the adolescent’s emerging
maturity will have an easier time communicating with the adolescent. The use of open-­ended questions, rather than closed-­ended
questions, will further facilitate history taking. (The closed-­ended
question, “Do you get along with your father?” leads to the answer
“yes” or “no,” in contrast to the question, “What might you like to
be different in your relationship with your mother?” which may
lead to an answer such as, “I would like her to stop always worrying
about me.”)
The goals of the interview or clinical encounter are to establish an
information base, identify problems and issues from the patient’s perspective, and identify problems and issues from the perspective of the
clinician, based on knowledge of the health and other issues relevant
to the adolescent age-­group. The adolescent should be given an opportunity to express concerns and the reasons for seeking medical attention. The adolescent and the parent should be allowed to express the
strengths and successes of the adolescent, in addition to communicating problems.
The effectiveness of an interview can be compromised when the
interviewer is distracted by other events or individuals in the office,
when extreme time limitations are obvious to either party, or when
there is expressible discomfort with either the patient or the interviewer. The need for an interpreter when a patient is hearing impaired

hematocrit to rise during male puberty; sexual maturity rating (SMR)
1 males have an average hematocrit of 39%, whereas those who have
completed puberty (SMR 5) have an average value of 43%. Tuberculosis (TB) testing is important in adolescents with risk factors, such
as an adolescent with HIV, living in a household with someone with
HIV, incarcerated, homeless, from a country where TB is common,
or those with other risk factors, because puberty has been shown to
activate this disease in those not previously treated. Hepatitis C virus
(HCV) screening should be offered to all adolescents 18 years and
older regardless of their risks. It should also be offered to adolescents
who report risk factors, such as IDU, received blood products or organ
donation before 1992, or long-­term hemodialysis. The rate of acute
hepatitis C has remained the highest among persons age 20-­39 years,
similar to age-­groups at highest risk for fatal overdose in the United
States and age at initiation of IDU among certain U.S. populations.
Compared with 2018, the greatest increase in the rates of acute hepatitis C were observed among those age 40-­49 years (31% increase),
followed by those age 30-­39 years (23% increase). For the first time
in more than a decade, the rate of acute hepatitis C decreased slightly
among those age 20-­29 years. Rates have consistently been lowest
among those age <20 years or ≥60 years. Sexually active adolescents
should undergo screening for STIs per CDC guidelines, regardless of
symptoms (see Chapter 163). There are clear indications for chlamydia
and gonorrhea screening of females ≤24 years old, but less sufficient
evidence to support routine screening in young men. Based on feasibility, efficacy, and cost-­effectiveness, evidence is insufficient to recommend routine chlamydia screening in all sexually active young men.
However, screening of sexually active young males should be considered in clinical settings associated with a high prevalence of chlamydia
(e.g., adolescent clinics, correctional facilities, sexually transmitted
disease clinics) and should be offered to all young MSM. HIV screening should be discussed and offered at least once to all adolescents age
15-­18 years and to younger and older adolescents who are at increased
risk. Routine screening of adolescents who are asymptomatic for certain STIs (e.g., syphilis, trichomoniasis, herpes simplex virus, HPV)
is not recommended. However, young MSM and pregnant adolescent
females might require more thorough evaluation for all sexually transmitted diseases. Because cervical cancer incidence is low and complications from procedures may outweigh benefits of screening adolescent
females, cervical cancer screening should not begin until age 21 years.

31,Chapter Unknown,General,1650,"Transitioning to Adult
Care
Joseph M. Truglio and Nikita Barai
The importance of thoughtfully and intentionally transitioning care
of adolescents from pediatric to adult services, particularly for adolescents with special healthcare needs (SHCN), has been recognized for more than 2 decades. The Society of Adolescent Health
and Medicine defines health care transitions as “the purposeful,
planned movement of adolescents and young adults (AYA) with
chronic physical and medical conditions from child-­centered to
the adult-­oriented health care system.” For adolescents with SHCN,
successful transition is associated with improved health outcomes
and quality of life, whereas poorly managed transitions may lead to
loss of a medical home and worsening of chronic disease control.
All adolescents, regardless of SHCN, are likely to benefit from the
autonomy, continuity of care, and self-­management skills that are
facilitated by a successful transition.
Guidelines emphasize that transition is a process, not an event,
and encompasses much more than simply the transfer of care from
one clinician to another. The guidelines make recommendations
and provide practice-­based resources for implementing elements of
transition support in pediatric, family medicine, internal medicine,
and combined internal medicine–pediatric practices. This includes
providing assistance for the patient in adapting to an adult model
of healthcare delivery as they transition from one practice/clinician
to another or as they transition between models of care within the
same practice. It also emphasizes the importance of the many members of the patient’s care team (primary and specialty care, physical
and occupational therapy, school and/or vocational support, mental
health clinicians, and so on) that support the patient before, during,
and after the transition process. Table 152.1 represents the key elements of healthcare transition. Tools to assist providers with these
steps are available online from the National Center for Health Care
Transition Improvement (www.gottransition.org).
The process begins with the development of a transition policy
and its dissemination to all families of young adolescents, ensuring
families understand that transition planning will be an element of
health maintenance and chronic care management visits throughout the adolescent years. By middle adolescence, a transition plan
should be developed with the youth and family caregivers and
updated at subsequent visits until the patient is ready for implementation of the adult care model in early adulthood. Periodic readiness assessments are key to planning and anticipating challenges.
Critical to the transition process is skills training for the adolescent
in communication, self-­advocacy, and self-­care. Some youth with
SHCN depend on caregivers for navigating the healthcare system
on their behalf, and it is not realistic to expect increased independence. For these youth, addressing guardianship, long-­term care
planning, and advance directives are important. Care coordination
facilitates navigation and engagement in an adult-­oriented health
system, especially for adolescents with SHCN. The goal is to help all
youth maximize their potential as they become young adults.

33,Chapter Unknown,General,1750,"Sex refers to the physical or genetic characteristics that differentiate
between biologic maleness or femaleness (e.g., sex chromosomes,
gonads, internal and external genital structures). Sex designated
(assigned) at birth is typically based on the appearance of the external genitalia. In the absence of atypical genitalia, which may indicate a
difference of sexual development requiring further evaluation, sex is
designated at birth as either male or female.
Gender identity refers to one’s internal core sense of gender. Gender is not binary, and although most people identify their gender as
being male (boy or man) or female (girl or woman), others may identify as both, neither, or another gender completely. The gender identity
of an individual cannot be known until they reach a certain level of
psychosocial development and self-­awareness to identify it themself.
Development of gender identity likely results from a complex interplay
of biologic, environmental, and cultural factors. This concept is supported by compelling studies in several biomedical disciplines including genetics, endocrinology, and neurology. Gender expression refers
to one’s external manifestations of gender (e.g., choice of name, pronouns, clothing, hairstyle), whereas gender role describes the behaviors, attitudes, and personality traits considered to be masculine or
feminine by a society or culture during a particular period.
Many cultures recognize and accept as normal more than two genders. In the Philippines, Bakla is considered a third gender; many are
community leaders. In India, the third gender is Hijras, and Aboriginal
(Australian) terms such as brotherboy and sistergirl are used to refer to
transgender and gender-­diverse people.",development,Growth and Development,Neonatal,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z

Indigenous Nations (America) peoples may have three to five genders: male, female, Two Spirits female, Two Spirits male, and transgender. Navajo refer to Two Spirits as Nádleehí (transformed), and the
Cheyenne term for Two Spirits is Hemaneh (half man, half woman). In
all these societies, Two Spirits people are honored and often leaders in
their tribe.
Cisgender refers to people who have a gender identity that aligns
with their sex designated at birth. Gender incongruence is the term
used when gender identity does not align with the sex designated at
birth. Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) is an umbrella term
used to describe a diverse group of people with gender incongruence.
All TGD gender identities are normal, healthy variations within the spectrum of possible gender identities. Individuals with gender identities that
are not exclusively male or female may describe themselves as gender
nonbinary, genderqueer, or genderfluid. Some of these individuals
may also identify as transgender while others may not.
Gender dysphoria refers to the distress experienced by TGD individuals caused by gender incongruence. This term replaced “gender
identity disorder” in the most recent Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders (DSM)-­5 published in 2013, focusing the clinical
concern on the distress an individual may experience because of gender dysphoria and underscoring the nonpathologic nature of TGD gender identities. Not all TGD individuals experience gender dysphoria,
and use of this term, although sometimes necessary to obtain gender-­
affirming therapies, may be considered offensive and stigmatizing by
some.
It is important to distinguish gender identity as separate from
sexual orientation, which refers to an individual’s sexual attraction
to another person. Gender identity does not predict sexual orientation, and a person with any gender identity may have any sexual
orientation.",adolescent|disorder,Adolescent Medicine,Adolescent,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z

access to gender-­affirming mental health and medical care. A higher
co-­occurrence of autism spectrum disorder among individuals with
gender dysphoria and vice versa has also been demonstrated in addition
to higher rates of homelessness, physical violence, substance abuse, and
high-­risk sexual behaviors compared to the general population.
In addition to determining the presence or absence of gender dysphoria as part of the psychodiagnostic evaluation, there are many
important reasons to consider involving a mental health gender specialist in the evaluation and care of TGD youth before and during the
provision of gender-­affirming medical care. Mental health gender specialists may (1) evaluate for the presence of and provide treatment for
coexisting mental health concerns, (2) provide family counseling and
supportive psychotherapy to assist youth with the exploration of their
gender identity and alleviate any distress secondary to gender dysphoria, (3) provide education, assist in decision-­making, and refer as indicated for gender-­affirming medical therapies, (4) educate and advocate
for TGD youth and their families in their community, and (5) provide
TGD youth and their families with information for support groups. An
emphasis should be placed on the nonpathologic nature of TGD gender identities, and conversion or reparative therapies aimed at changing an individual’s gender identity are ineffective and unethical (and
illegal in certain places) practices that should not be pursued.
Despite the increased risk for mental health comorbidities in TGD
youth, studies have provided evidence of protective factors resulting
in positive mental health outcomes. Education regarding and access
to gender-­
affirming medical interventions at early pubertal stages
resulted in less gender dysphoria and better mental health and well-­
being in TGD youth. Additionally, TGD youth with supportive family
environments have better mental health outcomes and quality of life.
This knowledge underscores the importance of involving a qualified
mental health professional to facilitate supportive home environments
as needed and educating TGD youth and their families on options for
gender-­affirming medical therapies.
Another aspect of support is to provide access to other children/adolescents who are TGD. Many have identified like-­minded friends in their

worsening of any underlying psychologic distress. Options available
to TGD youth vary depending on their pubertal and developmental
stage, and care should be individualized based on the goals of the

or patches, through subcutaneous or intramuscular injections, or via
implantation of subcutaneous pellets. Oral testosterone undecanoate is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved for use in

counsel patients on the potential transfer to others via direct contact
when transdermal formulations are used. Testosterone levels can be
monitored in the serum, with the eventual goal of achieving values in
the normal male range (typically 320-­1,000 ng/dL, depending on the
specific assay).
TGD individuals treated with testosterone should be educated on
the expected timeline of physical changes (see Table 153.10). Treatment will lead to some changes that are likely reversible and others
that are not, such as facial hair growth, which is irreversible without

been reported, emphasizing the need for ongoing contraceptive counseling in these individuals. If undesired uterine bleeding persists, or
if menstruation is causing significant dysphoria before the initiation of testosterone therapy, a progestin or other agent may be used

49,Chapter Unknown,General,2550,"Youth with nonbinary gender identities are increasingly presenting
for gender-­affirming medical care. Although current clinical care
guidelines recognize that gender exists on a spectrum and may not
always be binary, research and guidelines to date have been largely
grounded in the binary gender narrative. Some individuals with
nonbinary gender identities will seek treatment as outlined in current clinical practice guidelines, but not all will. The Endocrine
Society clinical practice guidelines state that tailoring of current
protocols to the individual may be acceptable if done within the context of accepted safety guidelines using a multidisciplinary approach
including mental health support. Additionally, the WPATH SOC
state they are intended to be flexible to meet the diverse healthcare needs of the individual, and health professionals may modify
them in consultation with their TGD patients. However, evidence-­
based protocols are not yet available for nonbinary individuals, and
neither the Endocrine Society nor the WPATH provide guidelines
specific to the care of nonbinary youth. Nonbinary individuals have
been shown to have higher rates of depression, anxiety, and self-­
harm compared to their binary transgender peers. In addition, they
often encounter more barriers in their attempts to access gender-­
affirming medical care, even when care is accessed at specialized
gender clinics. As a result, some feel forced to identify within the
gender binary to obtain desired medical therapies or choose to not
seek care.
Until future studies inform clinical practice guidelines outlining therapeutic approaches specific to nonbinary youth, gender-­
affirming care for nonbinary youth should be individualized.
Providers should frame care using the concept of embodiment
rather than transition, the latter implying a linear path within the
gender binary. Ongoing dialogue and support are essential in helping nonbinary youth navigate a potentially nonlinear path. Providers should explore the individual’s internal awareness of self,
specific areas of gender dysphoria, and their embodiment goals
to offer specific therapies toward affirming the individual’s gender. Specific expected outcomes of the possible interventions (e.g.,
increased facial hair with testosterone or chest growth with estrogen) should be discussed rather than describing therapies as masculinizing or feminizing in nature. Difficult decisions may need to
be made, particularly for nonbinary youth treated with pubertal
suppression who do not desire any secondary sex characteristics.
There is the potential for negative impacts on bone health from prolonged monotherapy with pubertal blocking agents, and this should
be avoided. Providers should expect to have conversations about
balancing the individual’s priorities in their specific embodiment
goals and to discuss the known potential risks and benefits of various treatment options in order to provide optimal care to their nonbinary patients. Patients should be counseled about the importance
of maintaining a minimum threshold level of sex steroids—typically
a normal adult range of either estrogen or testosterone—to preserve

Understanding a child’s or adolescent’s sexual and emotional development is an essential part of any comprehensive pediatric evaluation. For youth who are or might be gay, lesbian, or bisexual (GLB
also noted as LGB in the LGBT abbreviation), such understanding is particularly important. GLB youth as a group have the same
health and developmental needs typical of youth in general, and their
sexual orientation is part of the normal spectrum of human sexuality. However, they encounter distinct developmental challenges and
can have additional physical and mental health needs related to their
orientation and others’ reaction to it. Their sexual orientation may
be different from that expected by some families, peers, and society;
they are at risk of peer rejection, bullying, violence, or family nonacceptance more frequently than most youth. Although the majority of
GLB adolescents grow up physically and mentally healthy, they are at
increased risk for certain health problems as a result of these stresses
and the epidemiology of health threats such as HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). In addition, healthcare providers
may also have biases and assumptions about the GLB community
(Table 154.1).
Sexual orientation refers to an individual’s attraction to others
based on sex or gender. It encompasses emotional and erotic desires,
physiologic arousal, sexual behavior, sexual identity, and social
role. As sexuality develops, youth can be oriented entirely toward",pediatric|adolescent|infection|child|development,Adolescent Medicine,Adolescent,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z

of one’s same sex or gender, and bisexuality involves orientation
toward males and females. Gay is a common term for both males
and females who have same-­sex attractions; lesbian refers to gay
females. Increasing numbers of youth describe themselves as having a nonbinary gender identity (see Chapter 153). Accordingly,
some do not fit binary categories of sexual orientation and use other
terms to describe themselves, such as pansexual (attracted to all
genders). Those unsure of their orientation are curious or questioning. The term young men who have sex with men (YMSM) is
sometimes used in the research literature to denote male youth who
engage in sexual activity with other males, regardless of how they
identify themselves.",general pediatrics,General Pediatrics,Pediatric,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z

through adolescence with sexual experience, although one can be
aware of one’s orientation without having had sexual partners. Those
who fear nonacceptance may try to suppress or deny their orientation.
Consequently, various aspects of an individual’s orientation—attraction, behavior, and identity—may not always be consistent with each
other throughout development. Not all youth with homosexual attraction or experience identify as gay, consistent in part with reluctance
about having or revealing a gay identity and underscoring the differences among attraction, behavior, and identity. A report providing
national estimates of the number of high school students with GLB

55,Chapter 153,General,2850,"Sexual orientation development appears to begin prenatally and
continue through childhood and adolescence and into adulthood.
Both gender role behavior in childhood and sexual orientation in
puberty and adolescence are partly influenced by prenatal genetic
and neuroendocrine factors. Sociocultural and psychologic factors
also influence sexual development. A gay or lesbian sexual orientation is sometimes preceded developmentally in childhood by
nonconforming gender expression or variation from population
averages in expression of gender-­related behavior such as activities, interests, styles, and other attributes recognized as masculine
or feminine, like toy preferences and preference for playmates of
a particular gender. Childhood gender nonconformity is significantly associated with nonheterosexual orientation, especially in
males. However, it is not experienced by all gay or lesbian people,
and not all children with nonconforming gender role behavior
are gay or lesbian. When present, however, nonconformity causes
many gay people to feel different from peers during childhood, even
before sexual desire or identity emerges. Depending on the setting,
gender-­nonconforming children may experience ostracism, bullying, or family nonacceptance. These reactions to gender nonconformity can lead to later difficulty with gender-­related self-­esteem and
long-­term mental health problems.
Less frequently, gay or lesbian sexual orientation in adolescence
is preceded by childhood gender variant identity, a phenomenon
in which the gender identity of an individual at any age differs from
phenotypic sex and assigned sex at birth (see Chapter 153).",child|development,Adolescent Medicine,Adolescent,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z

sexual orientation (coming out) to family, peers, healthcare providers,

demographic groups may experience distinct developmental stressors.
A comprehensive understanding of a youth’s sexual development and
health must consider intersecting sociodemographic factors influencing
a youth’s experience of a nonheterosexual orientation. For example, race,

Among U.S. adolescents and young adults, YMSM, and especially Black
YMSM, continue to face the greatest prevalence of HIV/AIDS. Although
possible, female-­to-­female sexual transmission of HIV is inefficient, and
females who only engage in sex with females are less likely than other youth

GLB or questioning (see Chapter 153, Table 153.1, and Table 154.1).
They should receive the age-­appropriate history, examination, and
anticipatory guidance recommended for adolescents in general.
The physical examination and laboratory evaluation of GLB and
questioning adolescents are the same as for any teenager. However,
providers should appropriately screen for special potential medical
and psychosocial threats to GLB teenagers’ health.
A nonjudgmental healthcare environment is important, with
open communication and a positive relationship with youth and
families. In the waiting room, written material about sexual orientation, support groups, and community resources will signal openness to discussing sexuality. Registration forms recognizing the
possibility of same-­gender parents signal a safe setting (e.g., forms
can list parent/guardian #1, parent/guardian #2). Sexual history
questions should avoid heterosexual assumptions (e.g., ask “Are you
dating someone?” vs “Do you have a boyfriend/girlfriend?”). This
is important at all ages. For example, asking a 6-­year-­old male if he
has a girlfriend may convey an unsupportive message if he discovers
later that he would like a boyfriend. Explaining confidentiality and
incorporating into each adolescent visit private time with no parent
in the room (see Chapter 137) may facilitate discussing sexual orientation, as may use of appropriate health history forms such as the
American Medical Association’s Guidelines for Adolescent Prevention Services Questionnaire.
Clinicians should remember that any youth might be GLB whether
or not they are identified or perceived as such, so clinicians should not
presuppose a particular orientation (see Table 154.1). Competency in
conveying sensitivity, acceptance, and respectfulness; effective communication skills; and appropriate attention to privacy and confidentiality (including practices related to billing and record requests) are
fundamental to providing high-­quality care. While remaining attuned

Problems
Samantha V. Hill and Tamera Coyne-­Beasley
Adolescence is the first period of life where the major determinants of
morbidity and mortality are behavioral rather than congenital or infectious. As adolescents make the transition from childhood to adulthood, they establish behaviors that affect both their current and future
health. Adolescence is a time of immense biologic, psychologic, and
social change (see Chapter 150). Many of the psychologic changes have
a biologic substrate in the development and eventual maturation of the
central nervous system, particularly the frontal lobe areas responsible
for executive functioning (Fig. 155.1). In addition to cognitive development, there are both risk and protective factors for adverse adolescent
health behaviors that are dependent on the social environment and the
mental health of an adolescent (Table 155.1).
Many adolescents continually confront the task of making healthy
choices while struggling with impulsivity that can lead to unintentional consequences, such as injuries, sexually transmitted infections
(STIs), or drug overdoses. Adolescents are also challenged with adopting behaviors that will affect their future adult health, such as eating
nutritiously; engaging in physical activity; and choosing not to use
tobacco (including vapes and e-­cigarettes), alcohol, cannabis, or illicit
substances. Environmental factors and social determinants of health in
and among an individual’s family, peers, school, and community also
contribute to adolescents’ health and risk behaviors. The U.S. Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey, a school-­based survey of a nationally representative
sample of U.S. high school students, demonstrates that youth begin
engaging in behaviors that place their health at risk during adolescence
(Fig. 155.2).
Although according to the 2018 CDC National Health Interview
Survey (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/shs/tables.htm), a probability sample survey conducted annually, an estimated 83% of 12-­to
17-­year-­olds report excellent or very good health, 11% reported limitation in usual activities because of one or more chronic conditions, 10%

the leading causes of death overall among adolescents 15-­19 years of
age are (1) unintentional injuries, (2) suicide, and (3) homicide (Table

Within the adolescent population, disparities in health occur. Adolescent health outcomes and behaviors vary among populations that
can be defined by being Black, ethnicity, gender, education, income,
disability, geographic location (e.g., rural or urban), or sexual orientation. Health disparities result from multiple factors affecting social

Youths may be perpetrators, victims, or observers of violence (or any
combination of the three roles, wherein the roles are unclear), with
varying severity of impact on the individual, family, and larger community. Risk factors for youth violence include poverty, socially disorganized communities, war and other regional conflicts, substance misuse

a weapon such as a gun, knife, or club in the last 30 days; 2.8% carried
the weapon to school; and 7.4% reported being threatened or injured
with a type of weapon on school property. Males are more likely than
females to carry a gun or weapon and therefore may need more support and engagement at home and at school. These violence-­related
behaviors at school affect the general students’ perception of safety.
More than 8.7% of students did not go to school on one or more days
in the preceding 30 days because they felt it was unsafe. School-­based
prevention programs initiated at the elementary school level have been
found to decrease violent behaviors in students. Increased surveillance of students is warranted both on and around school property to
improve student safety.
Adolescent relationship abuse (dating violence/reproductive
coercion) occurs between two people in a close relationship and can
be physical (punching, kicking, hitting, shoving), emotional (shaming,
bullying, controlling, stalking), or sexual (forcing a partner to engage
in a sexual act when he or she does not consent to it). Incidents of adolescent relationship abuse are not uncommon, with 22.4% of females
and 15% of males experiencing some type of partner violence between
the ages of 11 and 17 years. It may start with teasing, name calling, or
shaming but often progresses electronically, with frequent calls, texting,
or posting sexual pictures of a partner on social media. Risk factors for
being a victim of adolescent relationship abuse include those who use
alcohol, believe violence is acceptable, have a lack of adult supervision,
or have a peer who is in a violent relationship. Most teens do not report
the behaviors because of fear of retaliation from the partner. Teens who
are victims of adolescent relationship abuse are more likely to experience decreased school performance, have thoughts about suicide, use
drugs and alcohol, develop an eating disorder, experience depression,
and are more likely to be victimized during college and into adulthood.

type of event associated with alcohol use, but the injuries span several
types, including self-­inflicted wounds.
Alcohol is often mixed with energy drinks (caffeine, taurine, sugars), which can result in a spectrum of alcohol-­related negative behaviors. Caffeine may counter the sedative effects of alcohol, resulting in
more alcohol consumption and a perception of not being intoxicated,
thus leading to risk-­taking behavior such as driving while intoxicated.

Cora Collette Breuner
Marijuana (cannabis, pot, weed, hash, grass), derived from the
Cannabis sativa hemp plant, is the most commonly used illicit substance. The main active chemical, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC),
is responsible for its hallucinogenic properties. THC is absorbed
rapidly by the nasal or oral routes, producing a peak of subjective
effect at 10 min and 1 hour, respectively. Marijuana is generally
smoked as a cigarette (reefer, joint), in a pipe, or ingested (edibles).
Although there is much variation in content, each cigarette contains
8–10% THC. Another popular form that is smoked, a “blunt,” is a
hollowed-­out small cigar (tobacco leaf) refilled with marijuana, and
thus also contains nicotine. Marijuana products (hash oil or leaf)
can also be used in some vaping devices or hookah pens. Hashish is
the concentrated THC resin in a sticky black liquid or oil. Although
marijuana use by U.S. teens has declined in the last decade, ∼25%
of high school students have used marijuana at least once during
the previous 30 days. About 8% of students report having tried
marijuana before age 13, with a range of 4.3–18.5% across various
states, indicating the need for early prevention efforts. Adolescents

Cora Collette Breuner
In MTF 2021, 4.6% of 12th graders reported using OTC diet pills in
their lifetime and 1.1% in the past 30 days. These include nonprescription stimulants of two general types: pseudoamphetamines, usually
sold by internet/mail order, and OTC stimulants, primarily diet and
“stay-­awake” pills. These substances usually contain caffeine, ephedrine, and/or phenylpropanolamine.
The misuse of a stimulant medication, defined as taking a stimulant not prescribed by a healthcare provider and not in accordance
with healthcare provider guidance, has been growing over the past
two decades, with an increase in prevalence rates of nonprescription
stimulant use among both adolescents and young adults in the past
10 years. Nonprescription use of methylphenidate (MPH) in 2000 was
1.2%, increasing to 2% for MPH and 7.5% for nonprescription mixed
amphetamine salts (AMPs) in 2015.
The majority of nonprescription stimulant users reported obtaining
the substances by diversion, a process for obtaining the substance from
peers. Diversion occurs quite often and can begin in childhood, adolescence, or young adulthood. Lifetime rates of diversion ranged from
16–29% of students with stimulant prescriptions. One survey reported
that 23.3% of middle and high school students taking prescribed stimulants had been solicited to divert their medication to others at a rate that
increased from middle to high school. It has been shown that 54% of
college students prescribed stimulants for attention-­deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) had been approached to divert their medication.
In U.S. college students, nonprescription use of stimulants is more prevalent among particular subgroups (males; members of fraternities/sororities; with lower grade point averages; more likely to use alcohol, cigarettes,
marijuana, MDMA, or cocaine) and types of colleges (northeastern region,
with more competitive admission standards). Lifetime prevalence of nonprescription stimulant use was 6.9% and past-­month prevalence 2.1%.
According to a survey of 334 ADHD-­diagnosed college students taking
prescription stimulants, 25% misused their own prescription medications.
Scholastic pressures, including the need to succeed academically, and persistent social and financial demands place many students at an increased
risk for misuse of various substances, especially at the end of school terms.
A web-­based survey of medical and health profession students found that
the most common reason for nonprescription stimulant use was to focus
and concentrate during studying.",child|medication|adolescent|disorder,Adolescent Medicine,Adolescent,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z

Breast development is often the first visible sign of puberty in the

pathologic breast disorders. Visual inspection of the breast tissue
should routinely be a component of the adolescent’s general physical examination. Breast development during puberty is described

breast, occurs in up to 65% of healthy adolescent males (see Chapter
625). The incidence of gynecomastia has increased over the past
20 years, suggesting that changes in the endogenous or exogenous
sex-­steroid environment have occurred. It is thought that an imbalance of estrogen and androgen concentrations contributes, at least
in part, to the development of gynecomastia. Elevations of insulin-­
like growth factor (IGF)-­1 have also been demonstrated. The onset
of physiologic gynecomastia typically is between 10 and 13 years,
peaking at SMR 3-­4. Careful physical examination is essential to
distinguish between true gynecomastia, characterized by a discrete disk of palpable glandular tissue under the nipple-­areolar
complex, and pseudogynecomastia, characterized by more diffuse,
bilateral adiposity of the anterior chest wall. Physiologic gynecomastia regresses spontaneously in up to 90% of adolescents within
18-­24 months but may transition into lipomastia. Reassurance and
continued observation are recommended in most patients; surgery
may be indicated in severe or persistent cases. No medical therapies
for gynecomastia have been approved for use in adolescents by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Small, noncontrolled trials of
antiestrogens, such as tamoxifen, appear promising, but more evidence is needed. Conditions associated with nonphysiologic gynecomastia include endocrine disorders, liver disease, neoplasms,
chronic disease, and trauma. It can also be seen as a late effect in
childhood cancer survivors. Although dozens of medications are
implicated as possible causes of gynecomastia, convincing evidence
exists only for a few, including several antiandrogens and other
exogenous hormones, isoniazid, antiretrovirals, and histamine-­2
receptor blockers. Calcium channel blockers, isotretinoin, statins,
certain antipsychotics, proton pump inhibitors, lavender, and tea
tree oil may be causative. Among drugs of misuse, alcohol, opioids, and anabolic steroids may be associated with gynecomastia,
but minimal evidence supports an association with marijuana or
amphetamines.
Other breast pathology in males is uncommon. Benign masses such
as neurofibromas, lipomas, and dermoid cysts have been reported in
the male breast. Males with Klinefelter syndrome have an elevated risk
of breast cancer (see Chapter 623), but this malignancy is otherwise
exceedingly rare in adolescents.

with trusted adults. Clinicians should normalize menstruation and
avoid unnecessarily medicalizing this natural process. Menstrual disturbances, including delayed onset, irregularity, heavy flow, and pain,
occur in 75% of adolescent females. For adolescents with minor variations from normal (Table 159.1), an explanation of symptoms and reassurance may be all that is needed. Severe dysmenorrhea or prolonged
menstrual bleeding can be not only frightening but a cause of persistent
morbidity requiring more intensive management, potentially including
referral to a specialist in adolescent gynecology.",symptoms|adolescent,Adolescent Medicine,Adolescent,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z

axis governing the menstrual cycle. Significant deviations from normal
should prompt a search for organic pathology in a logical and cost-­
effective manner. An accurate menstrual history is an important, but
often lacking, first step toward a diagnosis. At menarche, all patients
should be encouraged to track their periods.
A range of terms has previously been used to describe abnormal
menstrual bleeding. Terms such as “menorrhagia and metrorrhagia”
are imprecise, confusing, and not linked to any specific underlying
pathology. Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is the preferred term
for uterine bleeding that is abnormal in regularity, volume, frequency, or duration. AUB is further specified by adding descriptive
terms such as heavy menstrual bleeding or intermenstrual bleeding.
A qualifier is added to categorize the etiology of abnormal bleeding.
Of the nine categories, the three most relevant to adolescents are
ovulatory dysfunction (AUB-­O), previously referred to as dysfunctional uterine bleeding and discussed in Chapter 159.2; coagulopathy (AUB-­C); and not otherwise classified (AUB-­N).
In addition to a standard medical history noting hospitalizations,
chronic illness, and medication and supplement use, a complete history for evaluating a patient with menstrual irregularity should include
the timing of pubertal milestones, such as onset of pubic and axillary
hair and breast development; a detailed patient menstrual history; age
of menarche and overall menstrual pattern of mother and sisters; and a
family history of gynecologic problems. The complete review of systems
should elicit any changes in headache pattern or vision; the presence of
galactorrhea; and any changes in skin, hair, or bowel patterns. Changes
in diet, level of exercise, and sports participation are also important
factors when generating a differential diagnosis. The patient should be
interviewed alone, and the confidential history should assess substance
use, consensual sexual activity, forced sexual behavior, abuse, and other
psychosocial stressors.
Assessment of basic growth parameters should include weight,
height, and BMI and a thorough review of the growth chart. Physical examination should document heart rate, blood pressure, SMR,
signs of androgen excess, such as hirsutism or severe acne, and signs
suggestive of an eating disorder (see Chapter 41), such as bradycardia, cachexia, lanugo, or knuckle calluses. A careful external genital
examination should be performed. An internal pelvic examination is
rarely necessary in the absence of sexual activity. Any internal exam
being considered for young adolescents should be performed with
proper equipment and technique by a clinician with expertise in this
age-­group. Transabdominal pelvic ultrasound can be a useful adjunct
for evaluating anatomic abnormalities in the adolescent; when indicated, MRI can provide greater detail of pelvic anatomy.

Amenorrhea, the absence of menstruation, generally requires evaluation at age 15 years, or if there has been no menstruation within 3 years
of the onset of puberty (primary amenorrhea), or if there has been no
menstruation for the length of three previous cycles in a postmenarchal patient (secondary amenorrhea). However, the following caveats exist: lack of any pubertal signs by age 13 years in a female should
prompt evaluation for pubertal delay; in sexually active patients, or
those with other symptoms suggesting pathology, evaluation should
be initiated without waiting for three missed cycles; in patients whose
breast development started between age 8 and 9 years, observation
for >3 years may be warranted in some cases, given data suggesting

on the patient’s complaint, which is typically irregular (AUB/IMB:
intermenstrual bleeding) or heavy (AUB/HMB: heavy menstrual

care or comprehensive visit clinicians should document the first day of

evaluation is necessary when menstrual patterns vary too widely from
what is normal for age. Even in the first postmenarcheal year, menses are usually not less frequent than every 45 days. Menses become
increasingly regular with age, and by 3 years after menarche typically
occur every 21-­35 days, lasting 3-­7 days. Personal cycle duration is usually established by age 19 or 20 years.
In the early postmenarcheal years, the most common cause of AUB in
adolescents is anovulation caused by immaturity of the hypothalamic-­

causes of AUB and vaginal bleeding. Adolescents rarely present with
complaints of unusually short or light menses. However, short, light,

The consequences of sexual activity, including unintended pregnancy

barriers, including access to confidential care, may delay an adolescent’s ability to access reproductive healthcare until after initiation of
sexual activity, and many may become pregnant and/or acquire an STI
during this interval. Early and appropriate counseling and education
with adolescents, including direct discussion of the risks of unintended
pregnancy and STI prevention, can help to mitigate these risks; adolescents who plan sexual initiation are 75% more likely to use contraception at sexual debut. Therefore appropriate patient-­centered counseling
and provision of contraception as warranted are an essential component of comprehensive healthcare for adolescents. Female refers to cis-­

provided on site or be easily obtained through prescription or by referral. If adolescents are comfortable and willing to include their parents
in this discussion, it is also always helpful to engage parents in the
decision-­making process and address any parental questions and concerns. Providers should be aware of state laws affecting confidentiality
and an adolescent’s ability to access confidential contraceptive services
(see Chapter 151). Most states allow adolescents confidential access
to contraceptive services, but given that many adolescents are under
their parents’ insurance plan, confidentiality may be unintentionally
breached through billing and explanation of benefit statements, as well
as through the open notes mandate. This should be discussed with
adolescents, especially those who are very concerned about disclosing
sexual health information to their parents or guardians.
Counseling should include a review of all contraceptive methods
available that the adolescent can use safely (see U.S. MEC). Long-­
acting reversible contraception (LARC/IUDs and implants) is a safe
and effective option for many adolescents, including those who have
not been pregnant or given birth. The adolescent should be counseled
about method effectiveness using typical-­use failure rates. Although
it is important to highlight the methods most effective at preventing
pregnancy, it is also imperative to provide contraceptive counseling
within the framework of reproductive justice and to avoid any coercion
due to provider preference or bias. The focus of contraceptive counseling should be on the priorities of the adolescent, and the adolescent
should be allowed to explore all options and determine which method
is most appropriate for their contraceptive needs and priorities. It is
important to ask about use of withdrawal and discuss its risks given
that 60% of female teens have used it for contraception and it has a
typical-­use failure rate of 20%. Abstinence should also be discussed as
an option even if teens have engaged in sexual intercourse in the past.
Abstinence may be the best option if adolescents do not have another
method available at a particular time.
Necessary concepts to address while discussing individual methods include how effective the method is, how long the method works,
what behaviors are required for correct and consistent use, what side
effects may be seen, any noncontraceptive benefits of the method (e.g.,
reduced menstrual bleeding, protection from STIs), and what signs
or symptoms of complications should prompt a return visit. Reviewing common side effects allows teens to anticipate and cope with any
changes with reassurance and may avoid method discontinuation.
Weighing the possibility of certain side effects with the possibility of
an unintended pregnancy may also help with the conversation. It is
also important to address any specific misperceptions teens may have
for certain contraceptives regarding side effects, effectiveness, or effect
on future fertility.
Once an adolescent chooses a method, the provider and adolescent
should discuss clear plans on correct and consistent use of the chosen
method and strategies for appropriate follow-­up (see Table 160.1). Providers should help the adolescent consider potential barriers to correct and consistent use (e.g., forgetting to take a pill daily) and develop
strategies to deal with each barrier (e.g., use of reminder systems such
as daily text messages or phone alarms). The provider should assess
whether the teen understood the information discussed and may confirm by asking the teen to repeat back key concepts.
The U.S. Selected Practice Recommendations for Contraceptive Use
provides guidance for providers regarding when to start contraception,
how to be certain the woman is not pregnant at contraception initiation, and what examinations and tests are recommended before initiating contraception. Generally, women may start a contraceptive method
other than an IUD at any time, and an IUD may be placed when a
provider is reasonably certain that a woman is not pregnant. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines this as a patient
who has no symptoms or signs of pregnancy, is ≤7 days after the start
of normal menses, has not had sexual intercourse since the start of last
normal menses, and has been correctly and consistently using a reliable

contraceptive methods used among women of all ages. To decrease risk

rather than waiting for next menses, as long as the provider is reasonably sure that the patient is not pregnant. Providers are also encouraged to provide up to 13 pill packs at a time, based on evidence that
more pill packs provided is associated with higher continuation rates.
However, it is important to see an adolescent in follow-­up once starting

not occur each month, but at the end of each extended cycle. Extended
cycling of monophasic COCs for adolescents has some anticipated
benefits associated with increased ovarian activity suppression and may
decrease failure rates. Other advantages include menstrual suppression
in those patients in whom that is a priority and diminished frequency
of hormonal withdrawal (premenstrual) effects, including headaches
and migraines, mood changes, and heavy monthly bleeding. The most
common side effect of extended-­cycle OCs is intermenstrual bleeding
and/or spotting, with the total days of bleeding over the first year of

formulations are not available for extended-­cycle use. Providers can
refer to the U.S. Selected Practice Recommendations for Contraceptive
Use to counsel patients on how to manage late or missed COCs.
The short-­term adverse effects of COCs, such as nausea and weight
gain, often interfere with compliance in adolescent patients. These
effects are usually transient and may be overlooked by the beneficial effects of a shortened menses and the relief of dysmenorrhea.
The inhibition of ovulation or the suppressant effect of estrogens on

extended-­cycle pills. Patients may choose to use the Nuva Ring consecutively without any “ring-­free week” but should be aware that this can
carry a risk of breakthrough bleeding, as occurs with extended-­cycle
COC use. Annovera is FDA approved and offers a single ring, which

139,Chapter Unknown,General,7050,"Adolescent pregnancy is a multifaceted problem that requires multifactorial solutions. The provision of contraception and education
about fertility risk from the primary care physician is important but
insufficient to address the problem fully. Family and community
involvement are essential elements for teen pregnancy prevention.
Strategies for primary prevention (preventing first birth) are different from the strategies needed for secondary prevention (preventing second or more births). Over the past 30 years, many models of
teen pregnancy prevention programs have been implemented and
evaluated. Table 161.2 lists the common components of successful

Abstinence-­only sexual education aims to teach adolescents to wait
until marriage to initiate sexual activity but, unfortunately, does not
mention contraception. Abstinence education is sometimes coupled
with “virginity pledges” in which teenagers pledge to remain abstinent
until they marry. Other educational programs emphasize HIV and
STI prevention and in the process prevent pregnancy, whereas others
include both abstinence and contraception in their curricula. Sex education and teaching about contraception do not lead to an increase in
sexual activity. Teenagers who participate in programs with comprehensive sex education components generally have lower rates of pregnancy than those exposed solely to abstinence-­only programs or no sex
education at all.
In many U.S. communities, programs that engage youth in community service and that combine sex education and youth development
are also successful in deterring pregnancy. Programs vary in their sites
of service from schools to social agencies, health clinics, youth organizations, and churches. Programs must be tailored to the cultural background, ethnicity, age-­group, and gender of the group being targeted

(usually first trimester). Many are limiting abortion to 6 weeks or when
fetal heart beats are detected. The majority of states require a physician to

establishment of relationships outside the family may expose adolescents to environments with which they are unfamiliar and situations
that they are unprepared to handle; (2) dating and becoming comfortable with one’s sexuality may result in activities that are unwanted, but
the adolescent is too inexperienced to avoid the unwanted actions;
and (3) young adolescents may be naïve and more trusting than they
should be (see Chapter 150). Many teens are technologically competent, which gives sexual perpetrators access to unsuspecting vulnerable populations who were previously beyond their reach. Social media
and online dating sites represent a major risk for adolescents, as they
facilitate correspondence with individuals unknown to them or protective family members, while simultaneously providing a false sense of
security because of remote electronic communications. A determined
perpetrator can obtain specific information to identify the adolescent
and arrange for a meeting that is primed for sexual victimization.
Some adolescents are at higher risk of being victims of rape than
others (Table 162.1).",adolescent|growth|development,Adolescent Medicine,Adolescent,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z
151,Chapter Unknown,General,7650,"Sexual violence is a term that broadly encompasses criminal acts
including sexual assault, rape and sexual abuse, and which disproportionately affects adolescents and young adults. Because of the prevalence of sexual violence in the adolescent population, it is important
for healthcare providers to have a general understanding of the types
of sexual violence that may affect children and adolescents. Providers
should also be aware that every state carries their own legal definition
of these crimes. These definitions dictate if or how a crime is prosecuted, which could affect survivors who have disclosed sexual violence.
Delayed disclosures of sexual violence are common. The circumstances and relationship of the assailant to the survivor can often affect
if, when, and how a child or youth discloses an assault. Sexual violence
is typically perpetrated by someone who knows their victim; less frequently the assailant is a stranger. The gender of the survivor may also
affect the disclosure process. Males are less likely to disclose sexual violence compared with females. Individuals who are transgender, gender
nonconforming, nonbinary, or other noncisgender identities are less
likely to disclose sexual assault than those who identify as cisgender.",adolescent|child,Adolescent Medicine,Adolescent,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z

Adolescents and Young Adults
CHLAMYDIA TRACHOMATIS AND NEISSERIA GONORRHOEAE
• Routine screening for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae of all
sexually active females age <25 yr is recommended annually.
• Extragenital chlamydia and gonorrhea screening (pharyngeal or
rectal) can be considered on the basis of reported sexual behaviors
and exposure, through shared clinical decision-­making between
the patient and the provider.
• Routinely screen sexually active adolescent and young adult MSM
at sites of contact for chlamydia (urethra, rectum) and gonorrhea
(urethra, rectum, pharynx) at least annually regardless of condom
use. NAAT is preferred for provider or self-­collected specimens.
More frequent screening (i.e., at 3-­ to 6-­mo intervals) is indicated
for MSM, including those taking PrEP and those with HIV infection,
if risk behaviors persist or if they or their sex partners have multiple
partners or anonymous partners or have sex with illicit drug use.
• Consider screening for C. trachomatis of sexually active adolescent
and young adult males annually who have a history of multiple
partners in clinical settings with high prevalence rates, such as jails
or juvenile correction facilities, national job training programs, STD
clinics, high school clinics, or adolescent clinics.
HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV)
The following recommendations apply to testing for HIV:
• HIV testing is recommended for all adolescents and young adults
seeking STI evaluation and/or treatment who are not already
known to have HIV infection. Testing should be routine at the time
of the STI evaluation, regardless of whether the patient reports any
specific behavioral risks for HIV.
• The CDC and USPSTF recommend HIV screening at least once for
all persons age 13-­64 yr or 15-65, respectively.
• Persons at higher risk for HIV acquisition, including sexually
active gay, bisexual, and other MSM, should be screened for HIV
at least annually. Providers can consider the benefits of offering
more frequent screening (e.g., every 3-­6 months) among MSM at
increased behavioral risk for acquiring HIV.
• All pregnant adolescents should be tested for HIV during the first
prenatal visit. A second test during the third trimester, preferably at
<36 weeks’ gestation, should be considered and is recommended
for adolescents and young adults who are at high risk for acquiring
infection.
• HIV screening should be voluntary and free from coercion. Patients
should not be tested without their knowledge.
• Providers should use a laboratory-­based antigen/antibody (Ag/
Ab) combination assay as the first test for HIV, unless persons are
unlikely to follow up with a provider to receive their HIV test results;
in those cases screening with a rapid POC test can be useful.
• Providers should test for HIV RNA if initial testing according to the
HIV testing algorithm recommended by the CDC is negative or
indeterminate when concerned about acute HIV infection (https://
stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/50872).
• HIV screening should be discussed and offered to all adolescents
at least once by age 16-­18 yr and throughout young adulthood in
healthcare settings. HIV risk should be assessed annually for >13 yr
and offered if HIV risk factors are identified.",adolescent|treatment|infection,Adolescent Medicine,Adolescent,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z

MSM at least annually regardless of condom use. More frequent
screening (i.e., at 3-­ to 6-­mo intervals) is indicated for MSM who
have multiple or anonymous partners or who have sex with illicit
drug use.
SYPHILIS
• Syphilis screening should be offered to sexually active adolescents
reporting risk factors, including MSM.
• Routinely screen sexually active adolescent and young adult
MSM at least annually regardless of condom use. More frequent
screening (i.e., at 3-­ to 6-­mo intervals) is indicated for MSM who
have multiple or anonymous partners or who have sex with illicit
drug use.
• Screen women at 1st prenatal visit, at 28 weeks, at delivery if at
greater behavioral risk.
• Screen asymptomatic women who may have increased behavioral
vulnerability (history of incarceration, transactional sex, higher rate
in community).
• Providers should consult with their local health department
regarding local syphilis prevalence and associated risk factors that
are associated with syphilis acquisition.
HEPATITIS B VIRUS
• All MSM should be screened with HBsAg, HBV core antibody, and
HBV surface antibody.
• Vaccination against both HAV and HBV is recommended for
all MSM when a previous infection or vaccination cannot be
documented.
HEPATITIS C VIRUS AND UNIVERSAL HEPATITIS C SCREENING
• The CDC recommends hepatitis C screening at least once in
a lifetime for all adults age 18 yr and older, except in settings
where the prevalence of HCV infection (HCV RNA positivity) is
<0.1%.
• Hepatitis C screening for all pregnant women during each
pregnancy, except in settings where the prevalence of HCV
infection (HCV RNA positivity) is less than 0.1%.
• Screening adolescents younger than 18 yr old for HCV who report
risk factors, that is, injection drug use, receipt of an unregulated
tattoo, received blood products or organ donation before 1992,
received clotting factor concentrates before 1987, or long-­term
hemodialysis.
• Given the high HCV prevalence among young injection drug users,
screening should be strongly considered.
• All people living with HIV should be screened during the initial HIV
evaluations and at least annually thereafter.
• Screening should be performed using HCV antibody assays
followed by HCV RNA testing for those with a positive antibody
test.
• Routine screening of adolescents and young adults who are
asymptomatic for certain STIs (i.e., syphilis, trichomoniasis, BBV,
HSV, HAV, and HB) is not typically recommended.",infection|adolescent|hepatitis,Adolescent Medicine,Adolescent,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z

PID. PID (tuboovarian abscess) has rarely been reported in virgins and
is usually caused by E. coli and associated in some patients with obesity
and possible pooling of urine in the vagina.
PID is difficult to diagnose because of the wide variation in symptoms and signs. Many females with PID have subtle or mild symptoms,
resulting in many unrecognized cases. Healthcare providers should
consider the possibility of PID in young, sexually active females presenting with vaginal discharge or abdominal pain.
The clinical diagnosis of PID is based on the presence of at least one
of the minimal criteria, either cervical motion tenderness, uterine tenderness, or adnexal tenderness, to increase the diagnostic sensitivity
and reduce the likelihood of missed or delayed diagnosis. Providers
should also consider that adolescents are the population in whom PID
is typically diagnosed and thus should have a low threshold for initiating empirical treatment. In addition, the majority of females with
PID have either mucopurulent cervical discharge or evidence of white
blood cells (WBCs) on a microscopic evaluation of a vaginal fluid–
saline preparation. If the cervical discharge appears normal and no
WBCs are observed on the wet prep of vaginal fluid, the diagnosis of
PID is unlikely, and alternative causes of pain should be investigated.
Specific, but not always practical, criteria for PID include evidence of
endometritis on biopsy, transvaginal sonography or MRI evidence of

When eliciting a sexual health history, discussions should be appropriate for the patient’s developmental level. In addition to questions
regarding vaginal or urethral discharge, genital lesions, and lower
abdominal pain among females, one should ask about prior treatment
of any STI symptoms, including self-­treatment using nonprescription
medications. Dyspareunia is a consistent symptom in adolescents with
PID. Providers must ask about oral or anal sexual activity to determine
sites for specimen collection.
Urethritis should be objectively documented by evidence of inflammation or infectious etiology. Patient complaint without objective
clinical or laboratory evidence does not fulfill diagnostic criteria.
Inflammation can be documented by (1) observing urethral mucopurulent discharge, (2) ≥2 WBCs per high-­power field on microscopic
examination of Gram stain urethral secretions, (3) urine microscopic
findings of ≥10 WBCs per high-­power field of first-­void urine specimen, or (4) a positive urine leukocyte esterase test of a first-­void
specimen. Laboratory evaluation is essential to identify the involved
pathogens to determine treatment, partner notification, and disease
control. C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae NAATs of a urine specimen
are recommended. The presence of gram-­negative intracellular diplococci on microscopy obtained from a male urethral specimen confirms
the diagnosis of gonococcal urethritis.
An essential component of the diagnostic evaluation of vaginal,
cervical, or urethral discharge is a chlamydia and gonorrhea NAAT.
NAATs are the most sensitive tests available in such cases and are
licensed for use with urine, urethral, vaginal, and cervical specimens.
Many of the chlamydia NAATs are approved by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) to test patient-­collected vaginal swabs

specimen types. Female urine remains an acceptable chlamydia and

is the recommended specimen for male urethral infection. Gonorrhea and chlamydia NAATs perform well on rectal and oropharyngeal
specimens and can be performed by clinical laboratories that have
completed the appropriate verification studies to obtain Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) approval.
Evaluation of adolescent females with vaginitis includes laboratory
data. Traditionally, the cause of vaginal symptoms was determined by
pH and microscopic examination of the discharge. However, CLIA-­
waived point-­of-­care vaginitis tests are available. Using pH paper,
an elevated pH (i.e., >4.5) is common with bacterial vaginosis and
trichomoniasis. Because pH testing is not highly specific, discharge
should be further examined. For microscopic exam, a slide can be
made with the discharge diluted in 1-­2 drops of 0.9% normal saline
solution and another slide with discharge diluted in 10% KOH solution. Examining the saline specimen slide under a microscope may
reveal motile or dead T. vaginalis or clue cells (epithelial cells with
borders obscured by small bacteria), which are characteristic of bacterial vaginosis. WBCs without evidence of trichomonads or yeast
are usually suggestive of cervicitis. This evaluation has been consistently shown to be highly subjective, which is why there are more
NAAT tests available for diagnosis. The yeast or pseudohyphae of
Candida species are more easily identified in the KOH specimen
(Fig. 163.8). The sensitivity of microscopy is approximately 50%
and requires immediate evaluation of the slide for optimal results.
Therefore lack of findings does not eliminate the possibility of infection. More sensitive point-­of-­care vaginitis tests include the OSOM

Immunologic Basis
of Atopic Disease
Cezmi A. Akdis and Scott H. Sicherer
Allergic or atopic patients have an altered state of reactivity to common
environmental and food antigens that do not cause clinical reactions in
unaffected people. Patients with clinical allergy usually produce immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to the antigens that trigger their illness.
The term allergy represents the clinical expression of IgE-­mediated
allergic diseases that have a familial predisposition and that manifest as
hyperresponsiveness in target organs such as the lung, skin, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and nose. The significant increase in the prevalence
of allergic diseases in the last few decades is attributed to changes in
environmental factors such as exposure to tobacco smoke, air pollution, indoor and outdoor allergens, respiratory viruses, obesity, and
perhaps a decline in certain infectious diseases (hygiene hypothesis).
The incidence of allergic asthma and atopic dermatitis started to
grow to epidemic proportions after the 1960s. Since 2000, the prevalence of food allergy, eosinophilic esophagitis, and drug-­induced anaphylaxis has also risen to epidemic proportions. Currently more than
1 billion patients worldwide are expected to have at least one kind of
allergic disease. The hygiene hypothesis, biodiversity hypothesis and
epithelial barrier hypothesis are the three main hypotheses that propose mechanisms for the development of allergic diseases.",esophagitis|disease|dermatitis|development,Growth and Development,Pediatric,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z
180,Chapter Unknown,General,9100,"The relatively recent onset of the epidemics of allergic, autoimmune, and
metabolic conditions leads to the question of what might underlie their
development. A prominent hypothesis is the hygiene hypothesis, which
proposes that certain microorganisms or infections protect against
inflammatory diseases, and that their loss, due to hygiene measures,
results in an increase in allergy, asthma, and autoimmunity. Growing up
on a traditional farm has a protective effect from asthma and allergies,
which provides a prominent example of the hygiene hypothesis. Children in Amish communities in the United States, where traditional dairy
farming is practiced, are highly protected from asthma and allergies. In
contrast, Hutterite communities have a significantly higher prevalence of
asthma and allergies in children. Interestingly, they practice industrialized farming with extensive cleaning measures. Early development of a
T-­helper type 1 (Th1) response together with T-­regulatory cell (Treg)

182,Chapter Unknown,General,9200,"of the ability of Th1 cytokines to activate phagocytes and promote the
production of opsonizing and complement-­fixing antibodies. The Th1
component of allergen-­specific immune response contributes to chronicity and the effector phase in allergic disease. Activation and apoptosis of epithelial cells induced by Th1 cell–secreted interferon-­γ (IFN-­γ),
tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-­α, and Fas-­ligand constitute an essential
pathogenetic event for the formation of eczematous lesions in atopic
dermatitis and bronchial epithelial cell shedding in asthma.
Chronic lesions of allergic reactions are characterized by infiltration of
Th1 and Th17 cells. This is important because Th1 cytokines such as IFN-­
γ can potentiate the function of allergic inflammatory effector cells such as
eosinophils, thereby contributing to disease severity. Th17 and Th22 cells
link the immune response to tissue inflammation; IL-­17A and IL-­17F and
IL-­22 are their respective prototype cytokines. Although both T-­helper cell
subsets play roles in immune defense to extracellular bacteria, IL-­17 augments inflammation, whereas IL-­22 plays a tissue-­protective role. Cytokines in the IL-­17 family act on multiple cell types, including epithelial cells
and APCs, to cause the release of chemokines, antimicrobial peptides, and
proinflammatory cytokines to enhance inflammation and antimicrobial
responses. In addition, Th9 cells produce IL-­9, but not other typical Th1,
Th2, and Th17 cytokines, and constitute a distinct population of effector T
cells that promotes tissue inflammation. Figure 182.3 depicts the complex
cytokine cascades involving Th1, Th2, Th9, Th17, and Th22 cells.
Tregs are a subset of T cells thought to play a critical role in expression of allergic and autoimmune diseases. These cells have the ability to
suppress effector T cells of Th1, Th2, Th9, Th17, and Th22 phenotypes
(Fig. 182.4). Tregs express CD4+CD25+ surface molecules and immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-­10, IL-­35, and transforming growth
factor-­β (TGF-­β1). The forkhead box/winged-­helix transcription factor
gene FOXP3 is expressed specifically by CD4+CD25+ Tregs and programs their development and function. Adoptive transfer of Tregs inhibits the development of airway eosinophilia and protects against airway
hyperreactivity in animal models of asthma. T-­cell response to allergens
in healthy individuals shows a wide range, from no detectable response
to involvement of active peripheral tolerance mechanisms mediated by
different subsets of Tregs. Individuals who are not allergic even though
they are exposed to high doses of allergens, such as beekeepers and cat

186,Chapter 174,of tyrosine kinases responsible for positive and negative regulation of,9400,"The acute allergic response depends on IgE and its ability to bind selectively to the α chain of the high-­affinity FcεRI or the low-­affinity FcεRII
(CD23). Cross linking of receptor-­bound IgE molecules by allergen initiates a complex intracellular signaling cascade, followed by the release
of various mediators of allergic inflammation from mast cells and
basophils. The FcεRI molecule is also found on the surface of antigen-­
presenting DCs (e.g., Langerhans cells), but differs from the structure
found on mast cells/basophils in that the FcεRI molecule found on DCs
lacks the β chain. CD23 is found on B cells, eosinophils, platelets, and
DCs. Cross linking and FcεRI aggregation on mast cells and basophils
can also lead to anaphylaxis (see Chapter 174). Differential expression
of tyrosine kinases responsible for positive and negative regulation of
mast cell/basophil degranulation are thought to be responsible for this
aberrant allergic response.
The induction of IgE synthesis requires two major signals. The first signal (signal 1) initiates IL-­4 or IL-­13 activation of germline transcription at
the ε Ig locus, which dictates isotype specificity. The second signal (signal
2) involves the engagement of CD40 on B cells by CD40 ligand expressed
on T cells. This engagement results in activation of the recombination
machinery, resulting in DNA switch recombination. Interactions between
several co-­stimulatory molecule pairs (CD28 and B7; lymphocyte function–associated antigen-­1 and intercellular adhesion molecule-­1; CD2 and
CD58) can further amplify signal 1 and signal 2 to enhance IgE synthesis.
Factors that inhibit IgE synthesis include Th1-­type cytokines (IL-­12, IFN-­
α, IFN-­γ), IL-­10 from Tregs, Breg cells, and regulatory DCs and microbial
DNA containing CpG (cytosine-­phosphate-­guanine) repeats.",inflammation,General Pediatrics,Pediatric,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z
187,Chapter Unknown,General,9450,"Allergic diseases are characterized by peripheral blood and tissue eosinophilia. Eosinophils participate in both innate and adaptive immune
responses and, like mast cells, contain dense intracellular granules that
are sources of inflammatory proteins (see Fig. 169.1). These granule
proteins include major basic protein, eosinophil-­derived neurotoxin,
peroxidase, and cationic protein. Eosinophil granule proteins damage
epithelial cells, induce airway hyperresponsiveness, and cause degranulation of basophils and mast cells. Major basic protein released from
eosinophils can bind to an acidic moiety on the M2 muscarinic receptor
and block its function, thereby leading to increased acetylcholine levels
and the development of increased airway hyperreactivity. Eosinophils
are also a rich source of prostaglandins and leukotrienes (LTs); in particular, cysteinyl LT C4 contracts airway smooth muscle and increases
vascular permeability. Other secretory products of eosinophils include
cytokines (IL-­4, IL-­5, TNF-­α), proteolytic enzymes, and ROIs, all of
which significantly enhance allergic tissue inflammation.
Several cytokines regulate the function of eosinophils in allergic disease. Eosinophils develop and mature in the bone marrow from myeloid
precursor cells activated by IL-­3, IL-­5, and granulocyte-­macrophage
colony-­
stimulating factor (GM-­
CSF). Allergen exposure of allergic
patients causes resident hematopoietic CD34 cells to express the IL-­5
receptor. The IL-­5 receptor activation induces eosinophil maturation,
causing eosinophils to synthesize granule proteins, prolonging their
survival, potentiating degranulation of eosinophils, and stimulating
release of eosinophils from the bone marrow. GM-­CSF also enhances
proliferation, cell survival, cytokine production, and degranulation of
eosinophils. Certain chemokines, such as RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T-­cell expressed and secreted), macrophage inflammatory
protein-­1α (MIP-­1α), and eotaxins are important for recruiting eosinophils into local allergic tissue inflammatory reactions. Eotaxins mobilize
IL-­5–dependent eosinophil colony–forming progenitor cells from the
bone marrow. These progenitors are rapidly cleared from the blood and
either return to the bone marrow or are recruited to inflamed tissue sites.",inflammation|disease|development,Growth and Development,Pediatric,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z

194,Chapter Unknown,General,9800,"Obtaining a complete history from the allergic patient involves eliciting a description of all symptoms along with their timing and duration,
exposure to common allergens, and responses to previous therapies.
Because patients often suffer from more than one allergic disease, the
presence or absence of other allergic diseases, including allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma, food allergy, eosinophilic esophagitis, atopic
dermatitis, and drug allergy, should be determined. A family history
of allergic disease is common and is one of the most important factors
predisposing a child to the development of allergies. The risk of allergic
disease in a child approaches 50% when one parent is allergic and 66%
when both parents are allergic, with maternal history of atopy having a
greater effect than paternal history.
Several characteristic behaviors are often seen in allergic children.
Because of nasal pruritus and rhinorrhea, children with allergic rhinitis often perform the allergic salute by rubbing their nose upward
with the palm of their hand. This repeated maneuver may give rise
to the nasal crease, a horizontal wrinkle over the bridge of the nose.
Characteristic vigorous rubbing of the eyes with the thumb and side of
the fist is frequently observed in children with allergic conjunctivitis.
The allergic cluck is produced when the tongue is placed against the
roof of the mouth to form a seal and withdrawn rapidly in an effort to
scratch the palate. The presence of other symptoms, such as fever, unilateral nasal obstruction, and purulent nasal discharge, suggests other
diagnoses.
The timing of onset and the progression of symptoms are relevant.
The onset of recurrent or persistent nasal symptoms coinciding with
placement in a daycare center might suggest recurrent infection rather
than allergy. When patients present with a history of episodic acute
symptoms, it is important to review the setting in which symptoms
occur as well as the activities and exposures that immediately precede
their onset. Symptoms associated with lawn mowing suggest allergy
to grass pollen or fungi, whereas if symptoms occur in homes with
pets, animal dander sensitivity is an obvious consideration. Reproducible reactions after ingestion of a specific food raise the possibility of
food allergy. When symptoms wax and wane but evolve gradually and
are more chronic in duration, a closer look at whether the timing and
progression of symptoms correlate with exposure to a seasonal aeroallergen is warranted.
Aeroallergens, such as pollens and fungal spores, are prominent
causes of allergic disease. The concentrations of these allergens in outdoor air fluctuate seasonally. Correlating symptoms with seasonal pollination patterns of geographically relevant plants and trees along with
information provided by local pollen counts can aid in identifying the
allergen. Throughout most of the United States, trees pollinate in the
early spring, grasses pollinate in the late spring and early summer, and
weeds pollinate in late summer through the fall. The presence of fungal spores in the atmosphere follows a seasonal pattern in the northern United States, with spore counts rising with the onset of warmer
weather and peaking in late summer months, only to recede again with
the first frost through the winter. In warmer regions of the southern
United States, fungal spores and grass pollens may cause symptoms on
a perennial basis.
Rather than experiencing seasonal symptoms, some patients suffer allergic symptoms year-­round. In these patients, sensitization to
perennial allergens usually found indoors, such as dust mites, animal",symptoms|conjunctivitis|rhinitis|esophagitis|rhinoconjunctivitis|infection|disease|child|dermatitis|development,Growth and Development,Pediatric,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z
195,Chapter Unknown,General,9850,"dander, cockroaches, and fungi, warrants consideration. Species of
certain fungi, such as Aspergillus and Penicillium, are found indoors,
whereas Alternaria is found in both indoor and outdoor environments.
Cockroach and rodent allergens are often problematic in urban environments. Patients sensitive to perennial allergens often also become
sensitized to seasonal allergens and experience baseline symptoms
year-­round with worsening during the pollen seasons.
The age of the patient is an important consideration in identifying
potential allergens. Infants and young children are often first sensitized
to allergens that are in their environment on a continuous basis, such
as dust mites, animal dander, and fungi. Sensitization to seasonal allergens usually takes several seasons of exposure to develop and is thus
unlikely to be a significant trigger of symptoms in infants and toddlers.
Food allergies are more common in infants and young children,
resulting primarily in cutaneous, gastrointestinal, and, less frequently,
respiratory and cardiovascular symptoms. Symptoms of immediate or
IgE-­mediated hypersensitivity food reactions typically develop within
minutes to 2 hours after ingestion of the offending food. Symptoms
of non–IgE-­mediated food allergies are often delayed or chronic (see",symptoms|infant|child,Cardiology,Infant,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z

Complete information from previous evaluations and prior treatments for allergic disease should be reviewed, including impact of
changes in local environment (e.g., home vs school), response to medications, elimination diets, and duration and impact of allergen immunotherapy (if applicable). Improvement in symptoms with medications
or avoidance strategies used to treat allergic disease provides additional
evidence for an allergic process.
A thorough environmental survey should be performed, focusing
on potential sources of allergen and/or irritant exposure, particularly
when respiratory symptoms (upper/lower) are reported. The age and
type of the dwelling, how it is heated and cooled, the use of humidifiers
or air filtration units, and any history of water damage should be noted.
Forced air heating may stir up dust mite, fungi, and animal allergens.
The irritant effects of wood-­burning stoves, fireplaces, and kerosene
heaters may provoke respiratory symptoms. Increased humidity or
water damage in the home is often associated with greater exposure
to dust mites and fungi. Carpeting serves as a reservoir for dust mites,
fungi, and animal dander. The number of domestic pets and their
movements about the house should be ascertained. Special attention
should be focused on the bedroom, where a child spends a significant
proportion of time. The age and type of bedding, the use of dust mite
covers on pillows and mattresses, the number of stuffed animals, type
of window treatments, and the accessibility of pets to the room should
be reviewed. The number of smokers living in the home, and what and
where they smoke is useful information. Activities that might result
in exposure to allergens or respiratory irritants such as paint fumes,
cleansers, sawdust, or glues should be identified. Similar information
should be obtained in other environments where the child spends long
periods, such as a relative’s home or school setting.",symptoms|therapy|treatment|medication|disease|child,Pulmonology,Pediatric,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z

use of inhaled glucocorticoids in prepubertal children is associated
with a small initial decrease in attained height (1 cm) that may persist as a reduction in adult height. Poor weight gain in a child with
chronic chest symptoms should prompt consideration of cystic fibrosis. Anthropometric measures are also important to monitor in those
on restricted diets because of multiple food allergies or eosinophilic
esophagitis. Blood pressure should be measured to evaluate for steroid-­
induced hypertension. The patient with acute asthma may present with
pulsus paradoxus, defined as a drop in systolic blood pressure during
inspiration >10 mm Hg. Moderate to severe airway obstruction is indicated by a decrease of >20 mm Hg. An increased heart rate may be the
result of an asthma flare or the use of a β-­agonist or decongestant. Fever
is not caused by allergy alone and should prompt consideration of an
infectious process, which may exacerbate asthma.
Parents are often concerned about blue-­gray to purple discolorations
beneath their child’s lower eyelids, which can be attributed to venous
stasis and are referred to as allergic shiners (Fig. 183.1). They are found
in up to 60% of allergic patients and almost 40% of patients without
allergic disease. Thus “shiners” may suggest, but are not diagnostic of,
allergic disease. In contrast, the Dennie-­Morgan folds (Dennie lines)
are a feature of atopy (see Fig. 183.1). These are prominent infraorbital
skin folds that extend in an arc from the inner canthus beneath and
parallel to the lower lid margin.
In patients with allergic conjunctivitis, involvement of the eyes is
typically bilateral (see Chapter 188). Examination of the conjunctiva
reveals varying degrees of lacrimation, conjunctival injection, and
edema. In severe cases, periorbital edema involving primarily the lower
eyelids or chemosis (conjunctival edema that is gelatinous in appearance) may be observed. The classic discharge associated with allergic
conjunctivitis is usually described as “stringy” or “ropy.” In children
with vernal conjunctivitis, a more severe, chronic phenotype, examination of the tarsal conjunctiva may reveal cobblestoning. Keratoconus,
or protrusion of the cornea, may occur in patients with vernal conjunctivitis or periorbital atopic dermatitis as a result of repeated trauma
produced by persistent rubbing of the eyes. Children treated with high-­
dose or chronic corticosteroids are at risk for development of posterior
subcapsular cataracts.",symptoms|conjunctivitis|chemosis|esophagitis|diagnosis|fibrosis|disease|child|dermatitis|development,Growth and Development,Pediatric,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z
200,Chapter Unknown,"Xerosis, or dry skin, is the most common skin abnormality of allergic",10100,"The external ear should be examined for eczematous changes in
patients with atopic dermatitis, including the postauricular area and
base of the earlobe. Because otitis media with effusion is common
in children with allergic rhinitis, pneumatic otoscopy should be performed to evaluate for the presence of fluid in the middle ear and to
exclude infection.
Examination of the nose in allergic patients may reveal the presence of a nasal crease. Nasal patency should be assessed, and the nose
examined for structural abnormalities affecting nasal airflow, such as
septal deviation, turbinate hypertrophy, and nasal polyps. Decrease
or absence of the sense of smell should raise concern about chronic
sinusitis or nasal polyps. Nasal polyps in children should raise concerns of cystic fibrosis. The nasal mucosa in allergic rhinitis is classically described as pale to purple compared with the beefy-­red mucosa
of patients with nonallergic rhinitis. Allergic nasal secretions are typically thin and clear. Purulent secretions suggest another cause of rhinitis. The frontal and maxillary sinuses should be palpated to identify
tenderness to pressure that might be associated with acute sinusitis.
Examination of the lips may reveal cheilitis caused by drying of
the lips from continuous mouth breathing or repeated licking of the
lips in an attempt to replenish moisture and relieve discomfort (lip
licker’s dermatitis). Tonsillar and adenoidal hypertrophy along with
a history of impressive snoring raises the possibility of obstructive
sleep apnea. The posterior pharynx should be examined for the presence of postnasal drip and posterior pharyngeal lymphoid hyperplasia
(“cobblestoning”).
Chest findings in asthmatic children vary significantly and may
depend on disease duration, severity, and activity. In a child with well-­
controlled asthma, the chest should appear entirely normal on examination between asthma exacerbations. Examination of the same child
during an acute episode of asthma may reveal hyperinflation, tachypnea, use of accessory muscles (retractions), wheezing, and decreased
air exchange with a prolonged expiratory time. Tachycardia may be
caused by the asthma exacerbation or accompanied by jitteriness after
treatment with β-­agonists. Decreased airflow or rhonchi and wheezes
over the right chest may be noted in children with mucus plugging
and right middle lobe atelectasis. The presence of cyanosis indicates
severe respiratory compromise. Unilateral wheezing after an episode
of coughing and choking in a small child without a history of previous
respiratory illness suggests foreign body aspiration. Wheezing limited
to the larynx in association with inspiratory stridor may be seen in
older children and adolescents with vocal cord dysfunction. Digital
clubbing is rarely seen in patients with uncomplicated asthma and
should prompt further evaluation to rule out other potential chronic
diagnoses, such as cystic fibrosis.
The skin of the allergic patient should be examined for evidence of
urticaria/angioedema or atopic dermatitis (see Chapters 189 and 186).
Xerosis, or dry skin, is the most common skin abnormality of allergic
children. Keratosis pilaris, often found on facial cheeks and extensor
surfaces of the upper arms and thighs, is a benign condition characterized by skin-­colored or slightly pink papules caused by keratin plugs
lodged in the openings of hair follicles. Examination of the skin of the
palms and soles may reveal thickened skin and exaggerated palmar and
plantar creases (hyperlinearity) in children with moderate to severe
atopic dermatitis.",keratosis|rhinitis|sinusitis|otitis|cheilitis|adolescent|treatment|infection|cyanosis|fibrosis|xerosis|disease|child|dermatitis,Adolescent Medicine,Adolescent,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z

Behavioral Theories
Margo Candelaria and Susan Feigelman
The field of pediatrics is dedicated to optimizing the growth and
development of each child. Pediatricians require knowledge of normal growth, development, and behavior to effectively monitor children’s progress, identify delays or abnormalities in development, help
obtain needed services, and counsel parents and caretakers. To alter
factors that increase or decrease risk and resilience, pediatricians need
to understand how biologic and social forces interact within the parent–child relationship, within the family, and between the family and
the larger society. Growth is an indicator of overall well-­being, status of
chronic disease, and interpersonal and psychologic stress. By monitoring children and families over time, pediatricians are uniquely situated
to observe the interrelationships between physical growth and cognitive, motor, and emotional development. Observation is enhanced by
familiarity with developmental and behavioral theories that inform
one about typical patterns of development and provide guidance for
prevention or intervention for behavior problems. Familiarity with
theories of health behavior may assist clinicians in guiding patients and
families in disease management and wellness care.",pediatric|growth|disease|child|development,Growth and Development,Pediatric,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z
202,Chapter Unknown,General,10200,"The kidney is derived from reciprocal interaction between the ureteral
bud and the metanephric blastema. During the fifth week of gestation,
the ureteral bud arises from the mesonephric (Wolffian) duct and penetrates the metanephric blastema, which is an area of undifferentiated
mesenchyme on the nephrogenic ridge. The ureteral bud undergoes
a series of approximately 15 generations of divisions and by the 20th
week of gestation forms the entire collecting system, including the ureter, renal pelvis, calyces, papillary ducts, and collecting tubules. Signals from the mesenchymal cells induce ureteric bud formation from
the Wolffian duct as well as ureteric bud branching. Reciprocal signals
from the ureteric bud and, later, from its branching tips induce mesenchymal cells to condense, proliferate, and convert into epithelial cells.
Under the inductive influence of the ureteral bud, nephron differentiation begins during the seventh week of gestation.
By the 20th week of gestation, when the collecting system is developed, approximately 30% of the nephrons are present. Nephrogenesis
continues at a nearly exponential rate and is complete by the 36th week
of gestation. During nephrogenesis, the kidneys ascend to a lumbar site
just below the adrenal glands. At least 16 signaling agents have been
identified that regulate renal development. Defects in any of the signaling activities could cause a kidney not to form (renal agenesis) or to
differentiate abnormally (renal dysgenesis). Dysgenesis of the kidney
includes aplasia, dysplasia, hypoplasia, and certain forms of renal
cystic disease.
The fetal kidneys play a minor role in the maintenance of fetal
salt and water homeostasis. The rate of urine production increases
throughout gestation; at term, volumes have been reported to be 50
mL/hr. The glomerular filtration rate is 25 mL/min/1.73 m2 at term
and triples by 3 months postpartum. The increase in the glomerular
filtration rate is caused by a reduction in intrarenal vascular resistance
and redistribution of intrarenal blood flow to the cortex, where more
nephrons are located.",disease|development,Growth and Development,Pediatric,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z,2025-07-21T09:57:47.362495Z
