from childhood to adulthood. This period of development comprises
adolescence, which is divided into three phases—early, middle, and
late adolescence—each marked by a characteristic set of biologic, cognitive, and psychosocial milestones (Table 150.1). Although individual
variations in the timing and pace of development undoubtedly exist,
these changes follow a predictable pattern of occurrence. Gender and
culture profoundly affect the developmental course, as do physical,
social, and environmental influences (Fig. 150.1). Given the interaction of these domains, a biopsychosocial perspective is best suited to

6,Chapter Unknown,General,400,"of reproductive capacity. Two principal physiologic events occur
during puberty: adrenarche and gonadarche. Adrenal androgen production, chiefly dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), rises in
response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Increases in serum
concentrations of DHEAS result in the development of adult-­like body
odor and faint genital hair (adrenarche), occurring as early as 6-­8 years
of age. Gonadal sex steroid production occurs with activation of the
hypothalamic-­pituitary-­gonadal (HPG) axis (gonadarche). Maturation of the gonadotropin-­releasing hormone (GnRH) pulse generator
is among the earliest neuroendocrine changes associated with the onset
of puberty. Under the influence of GnRH, the pituitary gland secretes
luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-­stimulating hormone (FSH);
initially this occurs in a pulsatile fashion primarily during sleep, but
this diurnal variation diminishes throughout puberty. LH and FSH
stimulate corresponding increases in gonadal androgens and estrogens. The triggers for these changes are incompletely understood. The
activation of the HPG axis may be mediated by increasing adiposity
and associated insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, elevated androgens, and leptin. Both genetic and environmental (epigenetic) factors
contribute to the regulation of pubertal timing.",hyperinsulinemia|development,Adolescent Medicine,Adolescent,2025-07-21T09:52:29.457411Z,2025-07-21T09:52:29.457411Z

Although the ages at which individual pubertal changes occur may
vary, the timing and sequence of these changes relative to one another

exposures may also play a role.
In males the first visible sign of puberty and the hallmark of SMR 2
is testicular enlargement, beginning as early as 9.5 years, followed by
the development of pubic hair. This is followed by penile growth during

middle adolescents. Same-­sex attraction is common; sexual orientation may become clear to some adolescents, but still may be evolving in others during this time. Dating behaviors may be seen, but
this is culture dependent and may not be a popular construct for all
adolescents. Individual relationships often continue to emphasize
sexual attraction over emotional intimacy. Relationships that occur
during middle adolescence may be short and intense. Emotional
intimacy and more permanent relationships may not be seen until
late adolescence. At that time, relationships increasingly involve
love and commitment and demonstrate greater stability.
Body image may affect (and be affected by) adolescents’ psychosocial development as well. Early and middle adolescence are usually the ages during which poor or distorted body image and eating
disorders develop. Early adolescents undergo rapid physical changes
and may experience uncertainty about whether all these anatomic
and physiologic changes are progressing normally. Reassurance
from adults, including their healthcare providers, may be comforting. As puberty comes to an end and these changes slow, the middle
adolescent’s preoccupation may shift to whether they are attractive
to others. A strong emphasis on physical appearance during this
time is common. Although this focus on physical appearance may
continue into adulthood, late adolescence generally is characterized by a shifting balance toward introspection, with somewhat less
emphasis placed on external characteristics.
The timing of pubertal changes also can affect psychosocial development and well-­being. The progression of pubertal changes in males
is generally associated with a positive self-­
image. Early-­
maturing
males tend to have greater self-­confidence, social, and academic success, whereas later-­maturing males are at risk for more internalizing
behaviors and diminished self-­esteem. Females may initially perceive
changes in their physical appearance more negatively. This appears to
be especially true for early-­maturing females, some of whom experience greater decreases in self-­esteem, engage in more disruptive
behaviors, and have more conflict with their parents than do on-­time
or late-­maturing females. Early-­maturing females may be more comfortable associating with older peers and may subsequently be exposed
to peer pressure around things like sexual activity and substance use
at younger ages. Still lacking the cognitive skills to effectively navigate
these situations, they may be vulnerable to making poor decisions that
place their health and safety at risk. Many other factors influence how
adolescents experience puberty, and supportive peers and adults can
have a positive impact on psychosocial development at any maturational stage. With successful navigation of these domains, emerging
adults move into the world with a strong sense of personal identity
and their place in society. They are able to work toward a vocation
and financial independence and to manage the responsibilities of
adulthood.",adolescent|disorder|development,Adolescent Medicine,Adolescent,2025-07-21T09:52:29.457411Z,2025-07-21T09:52:29.457411Z

13,Chapter Unknown,General,750,"As adolescents develop more independence and parent–child
conflict peaks, providers should remind parents that this is typical and that arguing does not mean the adolescent does not value
the parents’ input and perspectives. Although some may rebel initially, most adolescents ultimately adopt a value system very similar
to that of their parents. Even if discussions feel ineffective to parents, they should continue to demonstrate and model these values
to their child. Similarly, rather than categorically dismissing their
child’s “negative” interests, such as playing a violent video game,
parents should be encouraged to use these opportunities to model
critical thinking about the impact of such an activity. Potentially
negative peer groups may be approached the same way, while fostering the development of positive peer networks. Authoritative
parenting, in which clear and appropriate negotiated limits are
set in the context of a caring and mutually respectful parent–child
relationship, is most strongly associated with positive psychosocial development. Parental connectedness and close supervision or
monitoring of the youth’s activities and peer group can be protective
against early onset of sexual activity and involvement in behaviors
that may threaten their safety and can foster positive youth development. Parents should also assume an active role in their adolescent’s
transition to adulthood to ensure that their child receives appropriate preventive health services.
Parents and providers may each work with adolescents to foster
good decision-­making. In addition to providing adolescents with
accurate and complete health information, the adolescent’s cognitive ability to use this information in various contexts must be
considered. Visits with providers can be used to promote independence among adolescents by spending time separately with both
caregivers and the adolescent, allowing the adolescent space to
voice concerns and receive appropriate information about making
healthy decisions and recognizing behaviors that may be placing
their health at risk.
Adolescents may find themselves needing to make important decisions in highly charged situations where they may be unable to manage their emotions and use their higher cognitive functions to examine
the consequences of their decision. For example, a couple in a sexual
situation with high emotional arousal may make the decision to proceed with unprotected intercourse. By anticipating this situation ahead
of time, under conditions of lower emotional arousal, and making a
plan to deal with this, they may make a different decision (e.g., stick
with their prior decision never to have sex without protection) when
the time comes. Parents and healthcare providers are in a position to
encourage and foster this anticipation and planning under conditions
of “cool cognition.”
Providers may need to help parents distinguish normal adolescent development and risk-­taking behaviors from possible signs of
a more serious mental health or conduct problem. Bids for autonomy, such as avoiding family activities, demanding privacy, and
increasing argumentativeness, are normal; extreme withdrawal
or antagonism may be dysfunctional, signaling a mental health or
substance use concern. Bewilderment and dysphoria at the start of
middle school are normal; continued failure to adapt several months
later suggests a more serious problem. Although some degree of risk
taking is normal, progressive escalation of risk-­taking behaviors
is problematic. In general, when the adolescent’s behaviors cause
significant dysfunction in the domains of home life, academics,
or peer relationships, they should be addressed by the parents and
healthcare provider, and referral to a mental health provider may be
considered. In most cases, parents can be reassured that although
adolescence can pose unique challenges, their adolescent, like most
adolescents, will come through it to become a successful and happy
adult.
At national and international levels, adolescents are at risk for environmental, health, behavioral, and societal challenges. Table 150.4 provides suggestions to address these issues.

Healthcare providers play an important role in nurturing healthy
behaviors among adolescents, because the leading causes of death and
disability among adolescents are preventable. Adolescence provides
a unique opportunity to prevent or modify health conditions arising
from behaviors that develop in the second decade of life and that can
lead to substantial morbidity and mortality, such as trauma, suicide,
cardiovascular and pulmonary disease, type 2 diabetes, reproductive
health issues, and cancer (see Chapter 150, Table 150.4).
Health systems in each community should be in place to ensure comprehensive and high-­quality care to adolescents. Health insurance coverage that is affordable, continuous, confidential, and not subject to

Quality-­of-­care data should be collected and analyzed by age so that the
performance measures for age-­appropriate healthcare needs of adolescents are monitored. Affordability is important for access to preventive
services. Family involvement should be encouraged, but confidentiality
and adolescent consent are critically important and should be addressed
with intentionality at each visit.
Healthcare providers, trained and experienced in adolescent care, should
be available in all communities. Healthcare providers should be adequately
compensated to support the range and intensity of services required to
address the developmental and health service needs of adolescents. The
development and dissemination of provider education about adolescent
preventive health guidelines have been demonstrated to improve the
content of recommended care (Table 151.1). The ease of recognition or
expectation that an adolescent’s needs can be addressed in a setting relates
to the visibility and flexibility of sites and services. Staff at sites should be
approachable, linguistically capable, culturally humble, and able to balance
trauma-­
informed care with healing-­
centered engagement approaches
with attention to equity and social determinants of health. Health services
should be coordinated to respond to goals for adolescent health at the
local, state, and national levels. The coordination should address service
financing and delivery in a manner that reduces disparities in care.
Although most adolescents in the United States have seen a
healthcare provider in the past year and report a usual source of
healthcare, adolescents are less likely to receive preventive care
services. According to the 2019 National Health Interview Survey,
an estimated 92% of 12-­to 17-­year-­old U.S. adolescents had a well
child visit within the past year. Uninsured adolescents are the least

The time spent on various elements of the screening will vary with
the issues that surface during the assessment. However, time for
screening and assessment is important for all adolescents, and the
ideal model of adolescent care requires a minimum of 20 minutes per
visit. For lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, intersex, and asexual youth (see
Chapters 153 and 154), emotional and psychologic concerns related to
their experiences, from fear of disclosure to the trauma of discrimination or bullying or violence, may direct the clinician to spend more
time assessing emotional and psychologic supports in the young person’s environment. For youth with chronic illnesses or special needs,
the assessment of at-­risk behaviors should not be omitted or deemphasized by assuming they do not experience the “normal” adolescent
vulnerabilities.

poses a new challenge to the provision of confidential health services
to adolescents.
Providers may elect to establish a policy of discussing with their adolescent patients when medical records and other information will be
disclosed and developing a mechanism to alert office staff as to what

24,Chapter 12,General,1300,"The preparation for a successful interview with an adolescent patient
varies based on the history of the relationship with the patient.
Patients (and their parents) who are going from preadolescence
to adolescence while seeing the same provider should be guided
through the transition. Although the rules for confidentiality are
the same for new and continuing patients, the change in the physician–patient relationship, allowing more privacy during the visit
and more autonomy in the health process, may be threatening for
the parent and the adolescent. For new patients, the initial phases
of the interview are more challenging given the need to establish
rapport rapidly with the patient in order to meet the goals of the
encounter. Issues of confidentiality and privacy should be explicitly stated along with the conditions under which that confidentiality may need to be altered, that is, in life-­or safety-­threatening
situations. For new patients, the parents should be interviewed with
the adolescent or before the adolescent to ensure that the adolescent does not perceive a breach of confidentiality. The clinician
who takes time to listen, avoids judgmental statements and the use
of street jargon, and shows respect for the adolescent’s emerging
maturity will have an easier time communicating with the adolescent. The use of open-­ended questions, rather than closed-­ended
questions, will further facilitate history taking. (The closed-­ended
question, “Do you get along with your father?” leads to the answer
“yes” or “no,” in contrast to the question, “What might you like to
be different in your relationship with your mother?” which may
lead to an answer such as, “I would like her to stop always worrying
about me.”)
The goals of the interview or clinical encounter are to establish an
information base, identify problems and issues from the patient’s perspective, and identify problems and issues from the perspective of the
clinician, based on knowledge of the health and other issues relevant
to the adolescent age-­group. The adolescent should be given an opportunity to express concerns and the reasons for seeking medical attention. The adolescent and the parent should be allowed to express the
strengths and successes of the adolescent, in addition to communicating problems.
The effectiveness of an interview can be compromised when the
interviewer is distracted by other events or individuals in the office,
when extreme time limitations are obvious to either party, or when
there is expressible discomfort with either the patient or the interviewer. The need for an interpreter when a patient is hearing impaired

hematocrit to rise during male puberty; sexual maturity rating (SMR)
1 males have an average hematocrit of 39%, whereas those who have
completed puberty (SMR 5) have an average value of 43%. Tuberculosis (TB) testing is important in adolescents with risk factors, such
as an adolescent with HIV, living in a household with someone with
HIV, incarcerated, homeless, from a country where TB is common,
or those with other risk factors, because puberty has been shown to
activate this disease in those not previously treated. Hepatitis C virus
(HCV) screening should be offered to all adolescents 18 years and
older regardless of their risks. It should also be offered to adolescents
who report risk factors, such as IDU, received blood products or organ
donation before 1992, or long-­term hemodialysis. The rate of acute
hepatitis C has remained the highest among persons age 20-­39 years,
similar to age-­groups at highest risk for fatal overdose in the United
States and age at initiation of IDU among certain U.S. populations.
Compared with 2018, the greatest increase in the rates of acute hepatitis C were observed among those age 40-­49 years (31% increase),
followed by those age 30-­39 years (23% increase). For the first time
in more than a decade, the rate of acute hepatitis C decreased slightly
among those age 20-­29 years. Rates have consistently been lowest
among those age <20 years or ≥60 years. Sexually active adolescents
should undergo screening for STIs per CDC guidelines, regardless of
symptoms (see Chapter 163). There are clear indications for chlamydia
and gonorrhea screening of females ≤24 years old, but less sufficient
evidence to support routine screening in young men. Based on feasibility, efficacy, and cost-­effectiveness, evidence is insufficient to recommend routine chlamydia screening in all sexually active young men.
However, screening of sexually active young males should be considered in clinical settings associated with a high prevalence of chlamydia
(e.g., adolescent clinics, correctional facilities, sexually transmitted
disease clinics) and should be offered to all young MSM. HIV screening should be discussed and offered at least once to all adolescents age
15-­18 years and to younger and older adolescents who are at increased
risk. Routine screening of adolescents who are asymptomatic for certain STIs (e.g., syphilis, trichomoniasis, herpes simplex virus, HPV)
is not recommended. However, young MSM and pregnant adolescent
females might require more thorough evaluation for all sexually transmitted diseases. Because cervical cancer incidence is low and complications from procedures may outweigh benefits of screening adolescent
females, cervical cancer screening should not begin until age 21 years.

31,Chapter Unknown,General,1650,"Transitioning to Adult
Care
Joseph M. Truglio and Nikita Barai
The importance of thoughtfully and intentionally transitioning care
of adolescents from pediatric to adult services, particularly for adolescents with special healthcare needs (SHCN), has been recognized for more than 2 decades. The Society of Adolescent Health
and Medicine defines health care transitions as “the purposeful,
planned movement of adolescents and young adults (AYA) with
chronic physical and medical conditions from child-­centered to
the adult-­oriented health care system.” For adolescents with SHCN,
successful transition is associated with improved health outcomes
and quality of life, whereas poorly managed transitions may lead to
loss of a medical home and worsening of chronic disease control.
All adolescents, regardless of SHCN, are likely to benefit from the
autonomy, continuity of care, and self-­management skills that are
facilitated by a successful transition.
Guidelines emphasize that transition is a process, not an event,
and encompasses much more than simply the transfer of care from
one clinician to another. The guidelines make recommendations
and provide practice-­based resources for implementing elements of
transition support in pediatric, family medicine, internal medicine,
and combined internal medicine–pediatric practices. This includes
providing assistance for the patient in adapting to an adult model
of healthcare delivery as they transition from one practice/clinician
to another or as they transition between models of care within the
same practice. It also emphasizes the importance of the many members of the patient’s care team (primary and specialty care, physical
and occupational therapy, school and/or vocational support, mental
health clinicians, and so on) that support the patient before, during,
and after the transition process. Table 152.1 represents the key elements of healthcare transition. Tools to assist providers with these
steps are available online from the National Center for Health Care
Transition Improvement (www.gottransition.org).
The process begins with the development of a transition policy
and its dissemination to all families of young adolescents, ensuring
families understand that transition planning will be an element of
health maintenance and chronic care management visits throughout the adolescent years. By middle adolescence, a transition plan
should be developed with the youth and family caregivers and
updated at subsequent visits until the patient is ready for implementation of the adult care model in early adulthood. Periodic readiness assessments are key to planning and anticipating challenges.
Critical to the transition process is skills training for the adolescent
in communication, self-­advocacy, and self-­care. Some youth with
SHCN depend on caregivers for navigating the healthcare system
on their behalf, and it is not realistic to expect increased independence. For these youth, addressing guardianship, long-­term care
planning, and advance directives are important. Care coordination
facilitates navigation and engagement in an adult-­oriented health
system, especially for adolescents with SHCN. The goal is to help all
youth maximize their potential as they become young adults.

33,Chapter Unknown,General,1750,"Sex refers to the physical or genetic characteristics that differentiate
between biologic maleness or femaleness (e.g., sex chromosomes,
gonads, internal and external genital structures). Sex designated
(assigned) at birth is typically based on the appearance of the external genitalia. In the absence of atypical genitalia, which may indicate a
difference of sexual development requiring further evaluation, sex is
designated at birth as either male or female.
Gender identity refers to one’s internal core sense of gender. Gender is not binary, and although most people identify their gender as
being male (boy or man) or female (girl or woman), others may identify as both, neither, or another gender completely. The gender identity
of an individual cannot be known until they reach a certain level of
psychosocial development and self-­awareness to identify it themself.
Development of gender identity likely results from a complex interplay
of biologic, environmental, and cultural factors. This concept is supported by compelling studies in several biomedical disciplines including genetics, endocrinology, and neurology. Gender expression refers
to one’s external manifestations of gender (e.g., choice of name, pronouns, clothing, hairstyle), whereas gender role describes the behaviors, attitudes, and personality traits considered to be masculine or
feminine by a society or culture during a particular period.
Many cultures recognize and accept as normal more than two genders. In the Philippines, Bakla is considered a third gender; many are
community leaders. In India, the third gender is Hijras, and Aboriginal

transgender and gender-­diverse people.",development,Growth and Development,Neonatal,2025-07-21T09:52:29.457411Z,2025-07-21T09:52:29.457411Z

Indigenous Nations (America) peoples may have three to five genders: male, female, Two Spirits female, Two Spirits male, and transgender. Navajo refer to Two Spirits as Nádleehí (transformed), and the
Cheyenne term for Two Spirits is Hemaneh (half man, half woman). In
all these societies, Two Spirits people are honored and often leaders in
their tribe.
Cisgender refers to people who have a gender identity that aligns
with their sex designated at birth. Gender incongruence is the term
used when gender identity does not align with the sex designated at
birth. Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) is an umbrella term
used to describe a diverse group of people with gender incongruence.
All TGD gender identities are normal, healthy variations within the spectrum of possible gender identities. Individuals with gender identities that
are not exclusively male or female may describe themselves as gender
nonbinary, genderqueer, or genderfluid. Some of these individuals
may also identify as transgender while others may not.
Gender dysphoria refers to the distress experienced by TGD individuals caused by gender incongruence. This term replaced “gender
identity disorder” in the most recent Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders (DSM)-­5 published in 2013, focusing the clinical
concern on the distress an individual may experience because of gender dysphoria and underscoring the nonpathologic nature of TGD gender identities. Not all TGD individuals experience gender dysphoria,
and use of this term, although sometimes necessary to obtain gender-­
affirming therapies, may be considered offensive and stigmatizing by
some.
It is important to distinguish gender identity as separate from
sexual orientation, which refers to an individual’s sexual attraction
to another person. Gender identity does not predict sexual orientation, and a person with any gender identity may have any sexual
orientation.",adolescent|disorder,Adolescent Medicine,Adolescent,2025-07-21T09:52:29.457411Z,2025-07-21T09:52:29.457411Z

access to gender-­affirming mental health and medical care. A higher
co-­occurrence of autism spectrum disorder among individuals with
gender dysphoria and vice versa has also been demonstrated in addition
to higher rates of homelessness, physical violence, substance abuse, and
high-­risk sexual behaviors compared to the general population.
In addition to determining the presence or absence of gender dysphoria as part of the psychodiagnostic evaluation, there are many
important reasons to consider involving a mental health gender specialist in the evaluation and care of TGD youth before and during the
provision of gender-­affirming medical care. Mental health gender specialists may (1) evaluate for the presence of and provide treatment for
coexisting mental health concerns, (2) provide family counseling and
supportive psychotherapy to assist youth with the exploration of their
gender identity and alleviate any distress secondary to gender dysphoria, (3) provide education, assist in decision-­making, and refer as indicated for gender-­affirming medical therapies, (4) educate and advocate
for TGD youth and their families in their community, and (5) provide
TGD youth and their families with information for support groups. An
emphasis should be placed on the nonpathologic nature of TGD gender identities, and conversion or reparative therapies aimed at changing an individual’s gender identity are ineffective and unethical (and
illegal in certain places) practices that should not be pursued.
Despite the increased risk for mental health comorbidities in TGD
youth, studies have provided evidence of protective factors resulting
in positive mental health outcomes. Education regarding and access
to gender-­
affirming medical interventions at early pubertal stages
resulted in less gender dysphoria and better mental health and well-­
being in TGD youth. Additionally, TGD youth with supportive family
environments have better mental health outcomes and quality of life.
This knowledge underscores the importance of involving a qualified
mental health professional to facilitate supportive home environments
as needed and educating TGD youth and their families on options for
gender-­affirming medical therapies.
Another aspect of support is to provide access to other children/adolescents who are TGD. Many have identified like-­minded friends in their

worsening of any underlying psychologic distress. Options available
to TGD youth vary depending on their pubertal and developmental
stage, and care should be individualized based on the goals of the

or patches, through subcutaneous or intramuscular injections, or via
implantation of subcutaneous pellets. Oral testosterone undecanoate is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved for use in

counsel patients on the potential transfer to others via direct contact
when transdermal formulations are used. Testosterone levels can be
monitored in the serum, with the eventual goal of achieving values in
the normal male range (typically 320-­1,000 ng/dL, depending on the
specific assay).
TGD individuals treated with testosterone should be educated on
the expected timeline of physical changes (see Table 153.10). Treatment will lead to some changes that are likely reversible and others
that are not, such as facial hair growth, which is irreversible without

been reported, emphasizing the need for ongoing contraceptive counseling in these individuals. If undesired uterine bleeding persists, or
if menstruation is causing significant dysphoria before the initiation of testosterone therapy, a progestin or other agent may be used

49,Chapter Unknown,General,2550,"Youth with nonbinary gender identities are increasingly presenting
for gender-­affirming medical care. Although current clinical care
guidelines recognize that gender exists on a spectrum and may not
always be binary, research and guidelines to date have been largely
grounded in the binary gender narrative. Some individuals with
nonbinary gender identities will seek treatment as outlined in current clinical practice guidelines, but not all will. The Endocrine
Society clinical practice guidelines state that tailoring of current
protocols to the individual may be acceptable if done within the context of accepted safety guidelines using a multidisciplinary approach
including mental health support. Additionally, the WPATH SOC
state they are intended to be flexible to meet the diverse healthcare needs of the individual, and health professionals may modify
them in consultation with their TGD patients. However, evidence-­
based protocols are not yet available for nonbinary individuals, and
neither the Endocrine Society nor the WPATH provide guidelines
specific to the care of nonbinary youth. Nonbinary individuals have
been shown to have higher rates of depression, anxiety, and self-­
harm compared to their binary transgender peers. In addition, they
often encounter more barriers in their attempts to access gender-­
affirming medical care, even when care is accessed at specialized
gender clinics. As a result, some feel forced to identify within the
gender binary to obtain desired medical therapies or choose to not
seek care.
Until future studies inform clinical practice guidelines outlining therapeutic approaches specific to nonbinary youth, gender-­
affirming care for nonbinary youth should be individualized.
Providers should frame care using the concept of embodiment
rather than transition, the latter implying a linear path within the
gender binary. Ongoing dialogue and support are essential in helping nonbinary youth navigate a potentially nonlinear path. Providers should explore the individual’s internal awareness of self,
specific areas of gender dysphoria, and their embodiment goals
to offer specific therapies toward affirming the individual’s gender. Specific expected outcomes of the possible interventions (e.g.,
increased facial hair with testosterone or chest growth with estrogen) should be discussed rather than describing therapies as masculinizing or feminizing in nature. Difficult decisions may need to
be made, particularly for nonbinary youth treated with pubertal
suppression who do not desire any secondary sex characteristics.
There is the potential for negative impacts on bone health from prolonged monotherapy with pubertal blocking agents, and this should
be avoided. Providers should expect to have conversations about
balancing the individual’s priorities in their specific embodiment
goals and to discuss the known potential risks and benefits of various treatment options in order to provide optimal care to their nonbinary patients. Patients should be counseled about the importance
of maintaining a minimum threshold level of sex steroids—typically
a normal adult range of either estrogen or testosterone—to preserve
